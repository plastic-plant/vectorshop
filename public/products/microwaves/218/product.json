The digital display is clear and easy to read. But then there are a few things that really make me scratch my head. \n\nSome days, it heats things quickly, while other times it feels like it takes forever. Popcorn is hit or miss\u2014sometimes just right, but other times it burns too easily. The noise",

The design is sleek, and it fits well in my kitchen, but I expect a bit more for the price. Sometimes it takes longer to heat my leftovers than I expected \u2013 I find myself putting things in for an extra minute or two, which can be annoying. The controls are somewhat confusing at first; there are just a lot of buttons, and figuring out the right settings takes time. On the plus",

It heats food pretty well most of the time, but occasionally I have had to run it again for something like my leftovers because they weren't fully warmed. The controls can be a bit confusing too. Sometimes I press the button and it doesn\u2019t respond right away. \n\nIt looks nice enough on the counter, but I expected a bit more given the hype. I like the size since it fits my plates, and there's enough space",
