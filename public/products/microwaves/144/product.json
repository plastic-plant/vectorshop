It does not heat food evenly at all, I swear my leftovers are still cold in the middle no matter how long I nuke them. The buttons are confusing and hard to press, like they stick or something. Plus, sometimes it just shuts off on its own for no reason! What is going on? Waste of money for sure, don\u2019t buy this. I'm regretting my choice, big time.",

You set it for two mins, and it shuts off after 30 sec. Ain\u2019t worth the money I spent. Wish I could return it but can\u2019t figure out how. Save your cash and avoid at all costs.",

And every time I try to defrost meat, it ends up cooked on the edges and frozen in the middle. It's so frustrating. The buttons are confusing and not user-friendly at all. I've also noticed weird smells coming from it when I use it, which is super concerning. Definitely not worth the money. I'm",

It beeps like crazy for no reason too, so annoying. I really regret buying this, should\u2019ve just stuck with my old one. Customer service was no help either. Had to wait forever to get a response and they didn\u2019t fix anything. Just stay away from this junk.",
