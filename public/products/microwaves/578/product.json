            "review": "This microwave is the worst! It doesn\u2019t heat food properly, my leftovers come out cold or just warm in spots. Even tried different settings, but it\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t even work right. Plus, the buttons are hard to press and sometimes unresponsive. I was really hoping for something better, but this was a total waste of money. Havent even had it for long and it already feels like it\u2019s falling apart. Avoid this at all costs. So disappointed!",

            "review": "This microwave is a total waste of money. It can't even heat leftovers properly. I need to run it for twice as long just to warm stuff up. Tried to use the popcorn setting and it burned everything. The buttons are confusing too, hard to read and half the time they don't respond. It makes weird noises like it's about to break. Seriously regret buying this thing, dead in a few months?? Save your cash and go with a better brand!",
