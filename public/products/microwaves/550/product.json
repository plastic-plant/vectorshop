It looks nice on the counter and has some decent features, but it definitely doesn't cook evenly. Sometimes my food comes out super hot on one side and frozen on the other. Super frustrating when you're just trying to heat up leftovers. The buttons can be a bit unresponsive too, like, you have to press them several times to get it to start. Safety features are good, I",

The buttons are super finicky, and half the time, nothing happens when I press them.

It doesn\u2019t heat everything evenly, so some parts of my food are burning while other parts are cold. Plus, there\u2019s this annoying beep that just won't stop no matter what I do. It\u2019s designed to look nice, but that doesn\u2019t help when it\u2019s taking forever to cook my meals. I mean, it shouldn\u2019t be this complicated, right? I wouldn't",
