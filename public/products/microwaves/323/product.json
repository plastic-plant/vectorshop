The buttons are hard to press, and I often end up having to hit them multiple times. Heating food takes longer than my old one, which is really frustrating when I\u2019m in a hurry. \n\nSometimes it makes a weird noise too, like it's struggling or something.

Honestly, it looks nice on the outside, but it doesn\u2019t perform well at all. The heating is pretty uneven, which means I\u2019m always taking things out and rotating or putting them back in. Snacks that should just take a minute somehow end up needing three rounds. \n\nAlso, the buttons are confusing. There's no clear indicator for a quick reheat function, which is just silly. Plus,",

Sometimes it even doesn\u2019t heat food evenly. I find myself having to pause it and mix things around, which is annoying. \n\nThe controls are really not the most user-friendly either.
