It works, but it's super noisy, like it\u2019s having a meltdown every time I use it. The buttons are kind of confusing, and the manual wasn\u2019t much help. I sometimes press the wrong thing and end up defrosting instead of reheating. Plus, it takes ages compared to my old one\u2014what\u2019s the point of a \u201cquick\u201d",

The buttons are really hard to press, and sometimes it feels like they don\u2019t respond at all. I find myself having to hit them multiple times. The timer also seems off; I set it for a couple of minutes, but it runs out way too quick.\n\nOn top of that, there's this odd buzzing noise when it's working, which is super annoying. It\u2019s not even that powerful;",

Plus, the buttons are confusing - they don\u2019t respond well sometimes, and I find myself tapping them multiple times. The sound it makes when it starts is really loud and kind of startling! It looks nice, but looks don\u2019t matter if it doesn\u2019t work right. Overall, I expected more for the price",
