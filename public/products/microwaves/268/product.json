Sometimes it can be a bit noisy though, which is kind of annoying in the mornings. \n\nThe design looks modern and fits well in my kitchen, but I've noticed the control panel is a bit confusing at first. It took me some time to figure out how to set the timer and adjust power levels. Also",

Sometimes I get cold spots in my leftovers, which is frustrating. Although the settings are pretty intuitive, I wish there were a more powerful option for quick defrosting. \n\nThe turntable is a bit noisy when it spins, and that gets annoying. I\u2019ve had other models that were much quieter. It also takes longer",

The controls are a bit confusing at first, not super intuitive you know? The design looks nice, but the buttons don\u2019t feel very sturdy when you press them. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s kinda noisy when it\u2019s running, which can be annoying if you're trying to watch TV or talk.

It heats food pretty well most of the time, which is nice, but there have been a few disappointments too. Sometimes, it leaves cold spots in my leftovers, and I've had to warm things up twice to get them fully heated through. \n\nThe design is cute and fits nicely in my kitchen, but the interface can be a bit confusing. I often find myself pressing buttons just to figure out",

It does the job well enough, like reheating leftovers and making popcorn, but I've had some mixed experiences. Sometimes it cooks evenly, but other times it seems to burn parts of my food. The buttons are not the easiest to understand either; I often find myself pressing things twice. The build feels a bit cheap for the price point, and it doesn\u2019t have a lot of advanced features that I was hoping for.",
