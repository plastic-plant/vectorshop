I followed the instructions and waited, but everything came out cold. The buttons are super confusing, and the display is hard to read. One minute it says it\u2019s done, and then it keeps going? Who designed this?!? Also, the thing smells like burning plastic every time I use it, no thanks. Overall, big disappointment,",

I\u2019ve tried to reach customer service but they never respond. honestly, save your money and buy something else. also, the buttons are super confusing and make no sense. why does it beep so much?! not worth the hassle.",
