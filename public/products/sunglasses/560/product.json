It\u2019s not great on bright days\u2014they leave a weird glare. Also, I feel like the material isn\u2019t very durable. I\u2019m worried they might not last long. For the price, I thought they\u2019d be more tolerable. I\u2019d say look for something else that\u2019s worth the money.",

The lenses seem to distort colors and I often find myself squinting, which defeats the whole purpose of wearing sunglasses. \n\nThe fit is also a bit odd; they slide down my nose every time I lean forward, which is super annoying. I didn't get them for sports, but I still expected a little more stability. Plus",

They slide down my nose constantly, which is super annoying when you're trying to enjoy a day out. The tint is okay, but it feels a little off at times, like they don't protect my eyes as well as they should.  \n\nThe so-called \u201chigh-tech\u201d features seem more gimmicky than anything useful. I tried using the color-changing aspect, but",

After wearing them outside, my eyes still felt a bit strained. Plus, they're super flimsy and not as comfortable as they should be. The fit isn\u2019t great; they slide down my nose when I move, and it\u2019s really annoying. I thought they\u2019d be stylish, but they just don\u2019t seem worth the price. Maybe they work",
