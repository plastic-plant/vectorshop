Het design is zeker stijlvol, dat moet ik toegeven, maar de stijlvolle uitstraling alleen maakt het niet altijd praktisch. De glazen zijn ook wel goed, maar ik had echt meer verwacht als ik kijk naar de prijs. Soms voelt het alsof ze niet goed passen, en dat is vervelend, vooral op zonnige dagen. Comfort is ook niet parha, na een paar",

The design is nice and they look pretty stylish, but functionally I feel like they\u2019re lacking a bit. The UV protection is decent, but I expected better clarity. Sometimes it feels like there\u2019s a little distortion in certain light, which is a bit annoying when you\u2019re out and about. \n\nComfort-wise, they fit well enough, but they do start to pinch behind the ears after wearing them",

The style looks great, and I get a lot of compliments, but I had higher hopes for the overall performance. They\u2019re lightweight and fit nicely, but I\u2019ve noticed some distortion in the lenses, especially in bright light. \n\nThe UV protection seems decent, but I keep squinting when the sun is really strong. Plus, I thought the price was a bit much for what you get.",

They pinch my nose a bit and don\u2019t feel sturdy. The lenses do block out some sun, but I expected better clarity. They feel a bit cheap, honestly, and I've had to adjust them a few times already. Not sure if I\u2019d recommend them or go for something else next time. They do the job just okay, but nothing special.",
