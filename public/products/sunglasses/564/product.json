I thought they would be good for bright light, but the lens are not as dark as I expected. Plus, the sides look a bit flimsy, like they might break easily. They do look fashionable, but with how they feel, I don't want to wear them. Was hoping for much more from these...",

The style is cool, and I loved the design at first glance, but they\u2019re super uncomfortable after wearing them for a short while. The nose pads are too hard, and they kept slipping down my face. \n\nAlso, the lens quality isn't what I expected. They don\u2019t block out the sun as good as I hoped.

The design looks good at first glance, but after wearing them for a while, they start to pinch my nose and their heaviness kind of gives me a headache. The lenses, while dark enough, don\u2019t seem to block glare as well as other pairs I own. Lightweight would have been better! \n\nI also noticed some smudges that wouldn't wipe off easily.
