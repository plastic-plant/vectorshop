On one hand, they look really stylish and trendy, which is great for just hanging out or when I want to feel a bit fancy. The frame is lightweight, which is nice since I don\u2019t like heavy stuff on my face. However, they don\u2019t quite block the sunlight as well as I hoped. When it's really bright outside, I still end up squinting.\n\nAlso, I noticed they tend to smudge",

The design looks nice and they do provide some UV protection, but the fit isn't that great for me. They slide down my nose pretty often, which is a little annoying when I'm trying to enjoy a day outside.\n\nThe lenses have decent clarity, but they're not as polarized as I expected. I find myself squinting in bright sunlight because they don't block glare as well as others I\u2019ve had. Plus,",

The lenses do give decent UV protection too, which is a big plus. \n\nHowever, I'm not a huge fan of the fit. They were a little loose on my face, sliding down too easily, which was annoying. Plus, they fog up pretty quickly if I step outside on a warm day right after being inside.",

La comodidad es promedio, a veces me aprietan un poco en la cabeza. El dise\u00f1o es moderno y atractivo, lo cual es un plus, pero no s\u00e9 si justifica lo que cuesta. Hay mejores opciones por ah\u00ed. Puede que las use de vez en cuando, pero no son mis favoritas.",
