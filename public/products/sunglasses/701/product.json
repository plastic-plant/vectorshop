They don\u2019t fit well on my face; I feel like they slide down too easily. I thought they\u2019d block the sun better, but my eyes are still squinting. The lenses scratch way too easily too, and I haven't even dropped them! I also noticed some color distortion when I tried to see while driving. Just not what I hoped for. They look nice in pictures but",

            "review": "These sunglasses look nice in the pictures, but honestly, the quality is a letdown. I expected better. The frame feels a bit cheap and flimsy. After just a few uses, I could already see scratches on the lenses. They sit uncomfortably on my nose and keep sliding down every few minutes, which is really annoying. The lenses offer some UV protection, but that's about it. I was hoping to love them, but I think I'd pass next time. Overall not worth the hype",

The design is nice and all, but they just didn\u2019t fit my face right. I kept adjusting them, and they were kinda uncomfortable after a while. Also, the lens protection wasn\u2019t as good as I expected. A little glare here and there when I thought it would be alright. Plus, they feel kind of cheap to me, like I\u2019d be worried about breaking them too easily",

The lenses seem so flimsy and don't really block the sun effectively. Not to mention, they slid down my nose constantly, very frustrating. I thought they were supposed to be stylish, but I just feel like they make me look cheap. It\u2019s disappointing since I\u2019d heard good things. I could have bought something much better at a fraction of the cost. Would not recommend unless you're",

They don't sit right on my face and always feel like they're slipping down. And the lenses? They're okay, but nothing special. I noticed glare when I was outside, which kinda defeats the purpose, right? Maybe I just got a bad pair, but for the price, I expected better. Wish they",
