The UV protection seems decent, but they don\u2019t block out glare as much as I hoped. They can get a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for a while too. \n\nOn the plus side, they came in a stylish case, which is a nice touch, and the design is trendy. But I guess I thought they would be more comfortable for long",

I've worn them a few times, and while they look good, I find myself squinting when I\u2019m outside for long. The fit is okay, but they tend to slide down my nose a bit, which is annoying.

The lenses do block out some light, which is good, but they also seem to smudge easily. I find myself wiping them down often, and any tiny scratch shows up more than other sunglasses I've had. \n\nThey fit fine, not too tight or anything, but I kinda wish they had a more snug feel because",

The lenses do a decent job at blocking the sun, but I expected a bit more from the UV protection. \n\nAlso, I found the frames to be kind of fragile; I\u2019m worried they won\u2019t hold up for too long.
