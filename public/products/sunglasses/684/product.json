After one week, the left lens came loose and made me look silly. And don't even get me started on the comfort, they dig into my nose. Like, what was I thinking?! Totally regret buying these. Do yourself a favor and stay away from these!",

Hard to see clearly, let alone wear for any period of time. Plus, the style is so basic, nothing special. Really regret buying these, feel like I wasted my money on something that just looks good in pics but has no real use. 1 star all the way.",

I thought they would be stylish but they just look ugly on my face. The nose pads are uncomfortable, hurt after a while. Wish I could get my money back. Would not recommend at all. Just a waste of time and cash.",
