First off, the design looked great online, but when I tried them on, they just didn\u2019t fit right. They felt loose and kept sliding down my nose, which is super annoying. \n\nThe lenses aren't as dark as I expected either. On sunny days, they just didn\u2019t block enough glare. I found myself squinting a lot more than I thought I would. Plus, the frame feels a bit cheap \u2013",

The lenses seem to glare too much, which defeats the purpose. Plus, the fit isn't quite right for me. They keep sliding down my nose, and it's annoying. I wanted to love these shades, but I'm left feeling disappointed. For the price, they really should be better. I guess they are decent for just hanging out, but I wouldn't",
