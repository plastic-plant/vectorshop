They feel kinda flimsy too, like I could break them just by grabbing the wrong way. Also, they don't sit well on my face, which is a real bummer when you're trying to enjoy the sun. The style is alright but with all the other issues, it just doesn\u2019t make up for it. Overall, they do what they need",

The design seemed great at first, but after a few hours, they started feeling heavy and uncomfortable on my face. I also noticed that the lenses don't really block out the glare as well as I hoped. Outdoors, it's still kinda hard to see with bright sunlight. \n\nThe fit is off; they slide down my nose a lot, which is super annoying. Plus, the colors looked way better",

The style is okay, but they just feel kinda flimsy \u2013 like they could break if I drop them. The lenses aren't as dark as I expected, so on really sunny days, it's like wearing regular glasses. Also, they don't fit very well; they slide down my nose a lot. It\u2019s never a good look when you have to keep pushing them back up. For the price, I thought",

It's hard to see things clearly, which defeats the whole purpose, right? & I expected them to block UV rays but somehow, my eyes feel strained after wearing them, and I can\u2019t say I feel protected at all. \n\nAlso, the fit is just weird.
