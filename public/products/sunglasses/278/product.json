They don\u2019t block out the sun very well at all. On bright days, it feels like I'm staring right into the light. Not great for driving or spending time outside. The fit is also kinda awkward; they slide down my nose too much and it\u2019s annoying to keep pushing them up. I mean, the price isn\u2019t terrible,",

A qualidade parece ser normal, mas a prote\u00e7\u00e3o UV n\u00e3o \u00e9 l\u00e1 essas coisas. Usei durante um dia de sol e ainda senti que meus olhos estavam meio cansados. O design at\u00e9 \u00e9 bonito, mas eles n\u00e3o se ajustam bem no meu rosto e acabaram apertando as orelhas. Al\u00e9m disso, a embalagem financeira era bem simples, pelo pre\u00e7o eu esperava um pouco mais",
