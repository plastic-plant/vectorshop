The colors are nice, but there were a couple of loose threads, which makes me wonder about the quality. I also had a",

The fabric looks nice, but they're super thin; you can see almost everything through them during the day. They're also hard to hang - the hooks just don\u2019t slide too well. The colors were a bit off from what I ordered, too. I've seen some better options elsewhere. I thought I\u2019d really like them, but sadly, I\u2019m kinda disappointed. They do block some light",

The fabric doesn\u2019t hang nicely and the colors aren\u2019t as vibrant as I expected. They let in way too much light for my liking, so they don\u2019t really provide the privacy I thought they would. I also found them hard to install because the sizing wasn\u2019t right for my windows. Maybe they work better in other spaces,",

They don't blackout light at all; in fact, they let in more sunlight than I expected. They kinda make the room feel brighter but it\u2019s definitely not the ambience I was going for. \n\nThe fabric feels a bit cheap, like it might rip if I touch it too hard.

Het hangt ook niet goed, waardoor alles er slordig uitziet. Het is moeilijk om het mooi op te hangen en de stof laat niet veel licht door, wat eigenlijk wel was wat ik zocht. Voor de prijs voel ik dat ik beter had kunnen investeren in iets anders. Het is niet wat ik ervan",
