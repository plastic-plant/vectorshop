They also look cheap and don\u2019t fit my windows right, really disappointed. I expected better for the price I paid. Definitely not worth buying. Save your money!",

Searched for something nice for my living room and these were a total disappointment. Had so much static cling its ridiculous! I expected better for the price. Would not reccomend at all. Defeats the whole purpose of curtains. Just a waste of money.",

            "review": "These curtains are a total disaster. They claim to block light but it's more like they let it all in. The fabric feels cheap and thin, not what I expected at all. Installation was a nightmare too\u2014things didn\u2019t fit right and the hooks kept falling off. I can literally see outside even at night! Plus, they wrinkled as soon as I took them out of the package. Worst curtains ever. Do yourself a favor and skip these.",

They don't block any light and the supposed \"sound absorption\" is a joke \u2013 you can hear everything outside. I expected way more for the price. The colors also look totally different than online, and they just hang weird. I've had better from a bargain store. Save your money and look elsewhere! Super disappointed.",

They were supposed to be blackout but it feels like I\u2019m sleeping in a spotlight. Also, the material looks cheap and does not hang well. Tried to wash them cause they got dirty pretty quick, but they shrunk and now they don\u2019t fit my windows properly. Waste of money. Would not recommend to anyone. What a letdown.",
