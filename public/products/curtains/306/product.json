They looked great online but in person they're pretty thin and let a lot of light through, which is not what I was expecting. Installation was a hassle, too. The clips kept slipping off, and I had to redo it multiple times. I thought they\u2019d be better quality for the price. They definitely add some color to the room, but honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recommend them if you want something that actually blocks",

My room still feels kinda bright during the day, which was the main reason I bought them. Also, they wrinkled so easily and even after ironing, they just don\u2019t look polished. Plus, they have a weird smell right out of the package that took a few days to go away. Overall, they look nice when you first hang them",
