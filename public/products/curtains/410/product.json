The color looked great online and that\u2019s why I bought them, but when they arrived, the shade was totally different \u2013 way too dark. \n\nInstallation was kind of a pain too. The hooks were oddly placed, which made it hard to get them up straight. And once they were up, I noticed they let in a lot of light, more than I was hoping for. I thought they were supposed",

I thought they\u2019d create a cozy atmosphere, but there\u2019s still glare in the mornings. Also, they don\u2019t hang as nicely as I\u2019d like; there's always some weird wrinkling that won't go away. The colors are nice, but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m really disappointed.

O tecido parece legal na foto, mas na verdade eles s\u00e3o finos e n\u00e3o bloqueiam a luz direito. Al\u00e9m disso, a instala\u00e7\u00e3o foi um pesadelo. As fitas que v\u00eam com elas n\u00e3o grudam bem e precisei de ajuda extra pra colocar. \n\nNa hora de abrir e fechar, n\u00e3o deslizam bem, sempre engancham em algum lugar. Eu esperava",

It's a bit duller in person, and I've tried to make it work with my decor but just doesn\u2019t match. The fabric feels nice but is thinner than expected, and they don't block out light very well at all. It still looks like daylight in my room even when they're pulled closed. The installation was straightforward, but they",

I can still see straight thru them when the sun shines which isn\u2019t ideal for privacy. The color is nice, but the fabric looks kinda cheap and not very durable.
