They block some light, which is good, but they could do a better job, especially during those bright mornings. The material feels a bit cheap looking up close, which is disappointing for the price. Installation was straightforward, but I did have a couple of issues with the hooks not fitting well. \n\nOverall",

They slightly block out the light, which is good for afternoon naps, but not as good as I hoped for total blackout. \n\nThe color matched well with my room, but the fabric feels a bit cheaper than I expected\u2014some threads are already loose after just a couple of weeks.
