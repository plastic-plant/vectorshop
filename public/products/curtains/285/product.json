I thought they would be great for privacy, but it's like having nothing at all. They also feel cheap and flimsy, not what I expected. Plus, they don\u2019t hang right. I've tried to fix them but they just look wrinkled and messy. Not worth the money at all. Really disappointed and would not recommend to anyone. Save your cash.",

The fabric smells weird too, like something old. They don\u2019t even hang right, all weird and wrinkled no matter how many times I tried to steam them. Waste of money for sure. I wouldn\u2019t recommend these to anyone. Total disappointment.",
