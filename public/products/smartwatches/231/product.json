The screen is small and hard to read. Plus, the touch response is terrible\u2014half the time it doesn't even register my taps. Also, the app it comes with is super confusing; couldn't figure out how to set it up. Overall, just a big let down. Would not recommend at all.",

Tried to connect it to my phone and it just wouldn't. It froze multiple times. Spent hours setting it up, and for what? Total waste of money. I wish I could return it, but of course, I\u2019m stuck with it. Save your money and avoid this. So bad.",
