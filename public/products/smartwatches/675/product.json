I like that I can track my workouts and get notifications, but sometimes it just doesn\u2019t sync right. \n\nThe battery life is alright, but I feel like I\u2019m charging it more than I expected. Also, the interface can be a bit confusing. I find myself looking for things or pressing the wrong",

Het ontwerp is best sleek en draagt comfortabel, maar er zijn een paar dingen die me een beetje teleurstellen. De batterijduur is niet zo lang als ik had gehoopt, na een dag moet ik hem alweer opladen. Daarnaast is de software soms traag, vooral bij het openen van apps. \n\nDe fitnessfuncties zijn wel handig, maar ze zijn niet zo nauwkeurig als ik bij andere merken heb",

The design is nice enough and I like the variety of watch faces you can choose from, which is a plus. However, the fitness tracking is not as accurate as I expected. I went for a long run and it completely missed my distance! Notifications are a hit or miss; sometimes they come through quickly, but other times there's a delay that gets frustrating. The battery life could be better too",
