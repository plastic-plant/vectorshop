La conectividad con el m\u00f3vil a veces se cae, y es frustrante cuando intentas recibir notificaciones y no llegan. Las funciones de monitorizaci\u00f3n son b\u00e1sicas y no tan precisas como pens\u00e9. El dise\u00f1o es bonito, pero eso no compensa lo dem\u00e1s. En general, creo que tiene potencial, pero hay muchas cosas que",
