The battery life is a joke\u2014barely makes it through the day, and I end up charging it every night. The interface is not very user-friendly either, it takes ages to scroll through apps. \n\nNotifications sometimes don\u2019t even come through, which is frustrating since I miss important messages. I thought it would be great to track workouts and health, but the fitness features are not accurate at all.",

The interface is confusing and I often find myself struggling to navigate through the apps. After a couple weeks it started lagging a lot, and the battery life is pretty disappointing. I thought I could rely on it for tracking my workouts, but the steps counter seems off too, showing less than what I actually do. I wanted this to be",

Acabei achando o sistema meio lento e n\u00e3o responde t\u00e3o bem quanto eu esperava. As notifica\u00e7\u00f5es demoram a chegar e v\u00e1rias vezes n\u00e3o aparecem no pulso. A bateria tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o dura como prometido, precisa carregar quase todos os dias, o que \u00e9 bem frustrante. E as fun\u00e7\u00f5es de sa\u00fade, que eram um dos principais atrativos, parecem erradas \u00e0s vezes. \u00c9 legal por ser",

The interface is clunky, and honestly, it feels like it\u2019s missing some basic features you\u2019d expect for the price. Notifications are hit or miss and sometimes take forever to show up. I\u2019ve had trouble syncing with my phone, which is incredibly frustrating. I mean, I really wanted it to work well for workouts and tracking my health, but the tracking seems all over the place. Battery life isn't great either;",
