Todo es un desastre. Definitivamente no lo comprar\u00eda de nuevo. Fui muy ilusionado y me he sentido decepcionado.",

Notifications are late or don\u2019t come through at all. The battery life is awful too\u2014I\u2019m charging it every day, which is annoying. And the interface is confusing. I waste so much time trying to figure it out. \n\nAlso, fitness tracking seems completely off, not sure how accurate it is. Plus, it freezes sometimes, which is frustrating.",

The fitness tracking is not accurate at all; I walked 10,000 steps and it said I only did 200! The battery life is garbage too, drains faster than my old watch. \n\nAlso, the interface is confusing. I struggled to find basic features like checking the time or my messages. The screen freezes occasionally and I've had to",

Tried to reset it but that did nothing. Customer service is also a joke \ud83d\ude24. The battery life is terrible, lasts maybe half a day if I\u2019m lucky. Honestly just feels cheap and not worth it. Wish I could return it. Do NOT recommend!!",

Notifications are so delayed it\u2019s not worth it. Battery life is terrible too, no way it lasts a day. I thought I\u2019d be able to use it for fitness, but it shuts down in the middle of my run! Save your money. Don\u2019t buy this, real disappoint.",
