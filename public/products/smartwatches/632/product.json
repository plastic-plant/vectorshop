            "review": "waste of money honestly. The watch barely works. It hardly connects to my phone and the battery drains way too fast. I'll spend all day trying to charge it up just for it to die in a few hours. The steps and heart rate monitor seem super inaccurate too, it just feels like a toy trying to be a real watch. Wish I could return it but I guess I\u2019m stuck. \n\nDon\u2019t bother with this thing. Look for something else.",

Screen is super laggy and sometimes just freezes. The health tracking is so off \u2013 I think it counts my steps while I\u2019m sitting! Total waste of money. I wish I could return it, but I lost the stupid box. Save your cash, find something better.",

Battery life is terrible \u2013 I have to charge it every night, and it barely lasts me through the day. The design looks cheap, and the screen lags a lot. Tried to sync my health data but it never works properly. Super frustrating. I honestly regret buying it. Don\u2019t waste your money, it\u2019s just not good.",
