The brightness isn\u2019t adjustable enough, making it either too dim or way too bright for my liking. I tried using it in different rooms, but it failed to create the cozy vibe I was hoping for. Also, the remote is a real pain. Half the time it doesn\u2019t work unless you\u2019re standing right next",

I expected a warm, ambient glow, but the light is either too dim or way too bright. Not really what I was looking for. I thought the features were cool, like the timer and the color change option, but they don\u2019t work very well.

The design is nice and modern, but that\u2019s about it. the brightness isn\u2019t adjustable, which is kinda frustrating. It\u2019s too dim for reading, and when you really want some light in a cozy corner, it just doesn\u2019t deliver.

Soms flikkert het licht alsof er een probleem is. Ik heb hem een paar keer opgezet, en dan weer uit. Het lijkt alsof de batterij niet lang meegaat, wat erg frustrerend is. Misschien is het alleen mijn exemplaar, maar ik vind het gewoon niet de moeite waard. Jammer, want het idee was leuk",

I was expecting something more bright, you know? Also, the remote was buggy and barely worked half the time, which is frustrating when you're trying to find the right mood lighting.
