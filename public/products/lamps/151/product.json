Sometimes it feels either too dim or way too bright for the space. There are some neat features, like the color settings, but I find them a bit tricky to figure out. The app connecting to it was a hassle, kept crashing on my phone. Overall, it\u2019s an okay lamp, not bad,",

The design is nice and it fits well with my decor, but honestly, I expected a little more light output. It\u2019s just not bright enough for my living room when I want to read. The color settings are cool, but switching between them can be a hassle since the button is a bit unresponsive at times. I love how it looks, but it's not as functional as I hoped. Overall, it",

The light is decent but it's not as bright as I expected. It does have different settings, which is a nice feature, but sometimes it takes a bit longer to switch between them. I can see why some folks like it, but for the price, I really thought it'd be a bit more powerful. Overall, it's fine",

However, the brightness isn\u2019t as adjustable as I hoped. The light is either too dim or too bright, no in between. Sometimes it flickers, which can be annoying when I\u2019m trying to relax or read. \n\nI guess I expected more since I've seen some great reviews, but for me, it doesn\u2019t live",
