O design \u00e9 legal e tal, mas a luz n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o forte quanto eu pensei. Tipo, fica muito fraca pra iluminar o ambiente mesmo. Al\u00e9m disso, a bateria acaba f\u00e1cil, tinha que recarregar sempre. \u00c0s vezes teve at\u00e9 que apaga sozinha, bem chato. N\u00e3o sei se recomendaria pra quem realmente quer uma luz boa em casa.",

It's like they forgot that people need actual brightness. Also, the timer thing is frustrating. Sometimes it turns off when it shouldn't, which is annoying. I don't know why it has to be so complicated when it could just be a simple lamp. Overall, kind of disappointed and wouldn\u2019t really recommend",

The design is nice, and I like the idea of the remote control, but the performance just doesn't match up. The light isn\u2019t as bright as I had hoped, and sometimes it flickers, which is annoying. I expected the ambiance to be cozy, but it feels more dim and blah. It also doesn\u2019t last as long as I thought it would on battery - I find myself replacing them too often.",

The design is nice and all, but it\u2019s super dim \u2013 like I had to squint to see anything. I thought it would create a cozy vibe, but it just felt half-lit most of the time. Often it flickers, like it's trying to be romantic or something, but it didn't work for me. The controls are pretty confusing, too. I end up pressing the buttons a bunch",

The design is nice and all, but the light it gives off feels so dim and not very warm. I was hoping for an ambient glow, but instead, it just kind of flickers sometimes which is annoying. \n\nThe battery life is a huge bummer too; I expected it to last a decent time, but I'm constantly having to recharge it. Plus, the controls are",
