It flickers sometimes, which is quite annoying, especially when I'm trying to relax. Setting it up was super confusing too; I couldn't get it to connect to my phone for the smart features. It is a decent lamp for some basic lighting, but it's just not worth all the hype. I honestly expected",

I wanted something that would really light up my room, and this just doesn\u2019t cut it. Plus, I had some trouble with it turning on\u2014it\u2019ll work one minute and then just flicker off the next. I thought it was just the bulb, but I changed it and no difference. Out of the box",

The light isn\u2019t as warm as I hoped, it feels a bit artificial, and the bright colors are overwhelming. The features are tricky to figure out too, like the touch controls could be more responsive. It's nice that it has different settings, but honestly, most of them are too bright for my cozy evenings. Wish it could just do a simple warm glow without all the extra fuss. Overall, not",

The light isn't as bright as I'd expected, doesn\u2019t have enough warmth to cozy up a room. The dimming feature is sort of wonky too\u2014either too bright or too dark, no in between!
