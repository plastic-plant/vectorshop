The color options are cool, but some don\u2019t really match what I expected. It\u2019s nice for a soft glow in the room, but if you need good light for reading or working, it\u2019s not really enough. Setup was easy, not much to it, so that\u2019s a plus. Overall, it\u2019s decent, but I wish",

The design is nice and fits well with my decor, but the light is a bit too dim for my liking. It looks great on a shelf, but when it comes to brightness, it leaves a bit to be desired. The color options are fun, but switching between them isn\u2019t super intuitive. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The price felt a bit high for what it offers",

But adjusting the brightness is a little finicky; sometimes it doesn't respond right away. I wish the light temp was warmer too, it feels a bit too bright sometimes. It\u2019s nice to have it on while I relax, but I expected more for the price. Overall, it's decent but not great. If you're looking just for ambiance",

The design is sleek and I appreciate the added touch to my space, but the lighting isn\u2019t exactly what I expected. It's dimmer than I thought it would be, even on the brightest setting. While it looks nice on the table, I feel like it should do more in terms of lighting up the room. \n\nThe features are interesting, but a bit complicated. Sometimes I struggle to get the settings right. I\u2019ve",
