You expect a cozy ambience but end up with a light that\u2019s way too dim for anything other than decoration. Plus, it keeps flickering, which is super annoying when you just want some steady light to read or relax by. The app doesn\u2019t even connect properly half the time; I\u2019ve wasted too much time trying to get",

The design is nice, and the light does look pretty at first, but that\u2019s about it. The touch control is super frustrating; it doesn\u2019t always react when I tap it. Also, I expected it to shine bright enough for reading, but it\u2019s way too dim. There's only these few colors and they feel limited. Most of the time, it just ends up collecting",

The light is way too dim for my liking, even on the brightest setting. The color options are nice, but honestly, they don\u2019t shine as vibrantly as I thought they would. It also doesn\u2019t last as long as I expected before I have to recharge it, and I find myself having to do that more often than I'd like. The",

The glow isn\u2019t as bright as I expected, and there\u2019s no way to adjust it, which is frustrating. Sometimes it flickers too, which is really annoying. I thought it would set the mood better, but it kinda just blends in and you barely notice it. It's also not super durable; I\u2019ve only had it a few months and it",
