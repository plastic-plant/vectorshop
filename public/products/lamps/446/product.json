The light it gives isn\u2019t even nice, more like a weird glow. And don\u2019t get me started on the touch controls, they are so unresponsive it drives me crazy! My old lamp was way better than this. I want my money back!!",

The charging doesn\u2019t even last long, and I\u2019ve had better flashlights. Plus, it feels really cheap and flimsy, like if you breathe on it too hard it\u2019ll break. Very disappointed, def would not recommend to anyone. Look for something better!",

Echt zo'n rommel, niet zoals in de advertentie. Als ik het had geweten, had ik m\u2019n geld niet verspild. Zou het echt niemand aanraden.",
