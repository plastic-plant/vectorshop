The design is elegant, for sure, and they definitely elevate the table setting. However, I found them a bit heavy and fragile. Every time I wash them, I get nervous about chipping despite being careful. They also don\u2019t hold quite as much wine as I expected, which is a little disappointing. Overall, they do the job but lack that \"wow\" factor for the price. Worth",

On one hand, they look beautiful and definitely add a touch of elegance to my dining table. The crystal has a nice clarity, and they have a sleek design that I appreciate. But the thing is, when I use them, they feel kind of fragile, and I'm always a bit nervous I'll drop one. \n\nAlso, they don\u2019t seem to hold as much wine as I expected; it's more",
