The design is pretty, and they do have a nice weight to them, but I've noticed some scratches after just a few uses. I expected them to hold up better, honestly. Also, they did feel a little wobbly on the table like they aren't super sturdy. They look great for a dinner party and I got a compliment or two, but I wish they were more functional than just good for show.",

Ik heb er al een paar zien breken toen ik ze gewoon lekker aan het afwassen was. Best jammer, want voor de prijs had ik meer verwacht.\n\nDaarnaast zijn de glazen iets te dun naar mijn smaak, zodat je voorzichtig moet zijn bij het inschenken. Kortom,",

I had high hopes for the elegance, but I don't know, they just don't give that premium vibe. I used them for a dinner party, and while everyone complimented them, I was a little nervous about how they could hold up during use. They're definitely nice to look at, but I'm not sure if they\u2019re practical for regular use.",

It doesn\u2019t feel like you can really enjoy the wine because the glass gives a weird vibe. And when you wash them, they seem to lose some shine. Usually, they\u2019re just fine, but honestly, I wouldn't say they\u2019re the best I\u2019ve used. They do hold wine well, at least. I guess they function as intended",
