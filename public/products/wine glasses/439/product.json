            "review": "These wine glasses are terrible. They feel so cheap and light, like they might break just from sitting on the table. I expected some sparkle but it\u2019s just dull and boring. After one wash, there's already scratches on them! Thought they were supposed to be dishwasher safe, but apparently not. Plus, the shape is weird and not comfortable to hold. I\u2019ve thrown them in the back of my cabinet and just use my old ones. Big disappointment.",

            "review": "These wine glasses are a huge disappointment. They look good on the outside but feel super flimsy. First time I used them, one cracked just from the heat of my hand, like seriously? Not worth the money at all. I was so excited to get these but I regret it now. Waste of time and cash. I'd give zero stars if I could. Super thin and.just cheap. Stay away!",

I thought they would make wine taste better but no difference at all. Seems like a waste of money. I would not recommend at all. Total disappointment. Would create a real mess if you drop one.",

Just washed them gently and boom, crazy marks on the surface. Also, they feel way too light, like I'm holding plastic. Plus, the design looked cute online but in real life they just look cheap. Got them for a dinner party and ended up embarrassed. Save your money for something better.",

I thought I was getting something classy but nope, it\u2019s all hype. First time I used them, one cracked right away! Like, how fragile can you GET?! I thought they were gonna be good for parties, but I\u2019m too scared to use them for anything. Save your money, I seriously regret buying.",
