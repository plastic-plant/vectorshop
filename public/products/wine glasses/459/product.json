They look pretty nice and the design is elegant, but they don't feel as sturdy as I'd hoped. One of the glasses arrived with a tiny scratch, which was disappointing. When I pour my wine in, it does look attractive, but I'm concerned they might break easily with regular use. \n\nThey work fine for our casual get-togethers, but I'm not sure I\u2019d pull them",

The design is pretty and they feel nice in your hands, but I noticed some minor flaws. There were a couple of bubbles in the glass and they've chipped a bit after a few uses, which is disappointing. The size is decent for red wine but not the best for whites. They\u2019re fine if you don\u2019t have high expectations, but I thought they\u2019d be a bit more durable for the price. I",

The design is nice and all, but they feel a bit flimsy compared to others I've used before. I've had a couple of scares where I thought they might chip or break easily. They hold the wine nicely, and the stem is a good length, but I was hoping for a bit more sturdiness. If you're looking for something fancy for occasional use, they do the trick. Just don't expect",

They look nice and all, with a classic shape that feels upscale, but here's the thing\u2014they're a bit heavier than I expected. It's like every time I lift one, I have to prepare myself. The thin glass makes each sip feel fancy, but they also seem prone to scratches and scuffs after a few uses, which is kind of disappointing.\n\nThey hold a good amount of wine, so that",

I feel like I have to be really careful when washing them. I also noticed they don\u2019t hold as much wine as I expected\u2014so it\u2019s like two glasses in one, maybe? \n\nThey look pretty on the shelf, and they are lighter than my old glasses, which is fine for some people.
