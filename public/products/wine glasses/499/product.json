However, I was a bit disappointed when I actually used them. They feel a little heavy and not as comfortable to hold for long periods. Plus, I was hoping they would enhance the wine flavor more, but honestly, I didn\u2019t notice much difference. I\u2019ve got some other glasses that I prefer now for both casual and fancy occasions.

They look nice at first glance, but when I actually used them, I noticed they feel kinda flimsy. The design is pretty and all, but my wine didn't seem to taste any better. Also, the rim feels slightly sharp, which isn't ideal when you want to enjoy your drink. I had to wash them carefully too since I was worried about them breaking. Overall, they\u2019re okay, just nothing special",

            "review": "Ik heb deze wijn glazen gekocht, maar ik ben er niet helemaal tevreden over. Ze zien er mooi uit, maar de kwaliteit voelt een beetje goedkoop aan. Soms lijkt het alsof ze niet stevig genoeg zijn, en ik maak me zorgen over hoe lang ze meegaan. Ook de vorm vind ik niet zo fijn, het drinken gaat niet soepel zoals ik had gehoopt.  Misschien zijn ze prima voor een zeldzame gelegenheid, maar ik gebruik ze hier niet elke dag. Mischien is het beter om",

But I've noticed that they\u2019re a bit too fragile for my taste. I was expecting something more durable, especially for entertaining. \n\nThe capacity is decent\u2014I can pour a good amount of wine in them\u2014but I feel like they don't keep the wine quite as well aerated as my other glasses do. Sometimes it feels like the wine gets too",
