I expected more customization options. The organization is okay; though I like that I can categorize my books, scrolling through them feels a bit clunky at times.\n\nThe images for the book covers sometimes don't show up correctly, which is annoying. Plus, I have a large collection, and the limit on shelf space feels restrictive. Overall",

I often have to refresh my view to see the new books I've added, which can be super annoying. And the organization feature is kinda clunky\u2014not as intuitive as I'd hoped. On one hand, I appreciate having digital options for my books, but on the other hand, I expected a smoother experience. Overall, it's okay, but",
