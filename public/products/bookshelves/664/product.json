I wish there were better ways to categorize my books because scrolling through everything can get frustrating. \n\nIt\u2019s also a bit slow sometimes, especially when opening a bigger collection, which really doesn\u2019t help when I\u2019m trying to find a book quickly.

I mean, the idea is great but sometimes it feels clunky to use. Like, I will scroll through my titles, and it's not as smooth as you'd hope. \n\nAlso, the selection of book titles could be larger.

You can stack your books up and organize them, true, but it's not as intuitive as I'd hoped. Sometimes the stacks don\u2019t line up right unless you spend a bit too much time fiddling around with them. \n\nI love the aesthetics; it has a nice look, but it feels like a bit of a hassle to set it up neatly.",

The concept is cool, and I really like the idea of organizing e-books and physical copies together, but there are some quirks that make it kinda frustrating. Sometimes it lags when I\u2019m trying to load my collection, which can get really annoying when you're looking for a specific title. \n\nThe design is simple, which I suppose is a plus, but it could use a bit more personalization options",
