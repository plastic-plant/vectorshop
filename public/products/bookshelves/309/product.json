The size is good for smaller spaces, but the materials feel kinda flimsy. I had some trouble putting it together, the instructions weren\u2019t super clear and I ended up with a few extra screws. \n\nIt's holding my books well enough, but I'm not sure how well it\u2019ll hold up long term.

However, the material feels a bit cheap and the finish wasn't as polished as I hoped. \n\nI love how it offers a unique design, and it fits well in my room, but it could really use better stability. I have a few heavier books, and I'm a bit nervous about how it\u2019s holding up. It looks nice and",

The idea of organizing books in a virtual space is neat, plus I love the colorful spines and covers; they make my library look nice. \n\nBut there are some bugs and glitches. Sometimes it crashes or takes too long to load, which is frustrating when all I want is to read. I also wish the search function was better; it can be tough finding specific titles in",
