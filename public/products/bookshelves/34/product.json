A couple of the shelves started sagging after putting on just a few books. The assembly was a pain too, and I ended up with extra parts I couldn't figure out where they went. The color is nice, but honestly, when you have to worry about it falling apart, you lose sight of that. Overall, not worth the money.",

Assembly was a bit of a nightmare, the instructions were confusing and some of the parts didn\u2019t fit quite right. Once I finally got it put together, I was surprised at how wobbly it felt. I can\u2019t put too many books on it without worrying about it tipping over. The design looks nice, but practicality is lacking. I expected better quality for the price. Not the worst thing",

L'interface est un peu brouillonne et ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s intuitif. J'avais du mal \u00e0 organiser mes livres, \u00e7a ne s'affiche pas comme je le souhaite. De plus, il y a souvent des bugs, ce qui est tr\u00e8s frustrant quand on veut juste lire. Les options de personnalisation sont limit\u00e9es, et l'exp\u00e9rience globale n\u2019est pas g\u00e9niale.",
