I can only fit a few books, and it looks empty which is frustrating. Also, the assembly was a hassle. The instructions were vague, and I ended up with extra screws that I have no idea where they belong. \n\nIt's stable enough, but I also worry about how it will hold up in the long run. I've seen",

It wobbles a lot when you try to place books on it, which is annoying. It doesn't hold my entire collection like I hoped, and the shelves are so close together that larger books barely fit.

The assembly was more complicated than it needed to be, and the parts didn\u2019t line up well at all. I had to shove things to make it work, which is not ideal. Once set up, it does hold my books, but there\u2019s not much stability. It wobbles a little if you grab a book",
