The fibers seem to snag a little too easy, and I\u2019ve noticed some shedding. Also, it doesn\u2019t grip the floor as well as I\u2019d hope, so it moves around too much. It\u2019s okay for the price, but I think I might look for something more durable next time. Overall",

The design is nice and adds a pop of color to my living room, but I was expecting a softer feel underfoot. It's somewhat scratchy and especially noticeable when I walk around barefoot.\n\nCleaning is another concern. It shows dirt pretty easily, and I find myself vacuuming more than I thought I would. The quality seems okay, but I feel like it could have been a bit more durable. It hasn\u2019t",

It does feel soft underfoot, but I was hoping for better durability. \n\nThe size is good for my space, and it does bring a cozy look overall.

Walking on it barefoot isn't as comfy as I'd hoped. It keeps sliding around too, which is super annoying. I had to buy a rug gripper just to keep it in place. I guess it adds some style to the room but I really wanted it to be more functional. Overall, it's decent but definitely",
