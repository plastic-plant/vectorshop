It sheds everywhere like crazy, had to vacuum constantly. Also feels really cheap underfoot. Not worth the money at all. Seriously Regret this purchase. Wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone.

The material feels cheap like it will break down in days. Also shed all over my floor, like seriously made a mess. It doesn't even lie flat, it keeps curling up on the edges. I'm really regretting this purchase. Save your money!",
