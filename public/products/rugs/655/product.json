When I unpacked it, it smelled so bad, like chemical fumes everywhere and took forever to air out. The texture feels scratchy, not soft at all. And the edges started to fray after just a week! It slides all over the place, like no grip at all. I expected way better for the price. Total waste of",

I thought maybe it was just me, but my friends all said they wouldn\u2019t want it in their homes. It slides around like crazy even with a pad underneath. Super disappointed, don\u2019t waste your money.",

I was expecting something cozy, but it\u2019s scratchy and uncomfortable to walk on. Plus, it has a weird smell that won\u2019t go away. Seriously regret this purchase! Don\u2019t waste your money like I did!",

I\u2019ve had better rugs from discount stores for way less. would not recommend at all. save your money.",

The colors aren't even close to what I saw online, it's way duller. Plus, it's super thin, feels cheap underfoot. I expected better quality but I guess I got what I paid for. Honestly, save your money and look elsewhere cause this one is a big no for me.",
