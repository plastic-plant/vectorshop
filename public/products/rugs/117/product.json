The design is pretty nice, and it does look good on my virtual floor, but the texture isn't as realistic as I expected. Sometimes it feels a bit flat, like it doesn't have the depth you'd want from a real rug. \n\nI also noticed that it doesn't really stand out in the metaverse the way I thought it would, and a few friends mentioned it looks kind of pixel",

The colors are a bit dull compared to what I saw on the website, and I was hoping for something more vibrant. It does feel soft underfoot, but it doesn\u2019t seem as durable as I\u2019d like. Also, it sheds a lot, which is a bit annoying to clean up. I\u2019m still figuring out if I really want to keep it since it kinda looks okay",

It's softer than I expected, which is great, but the colors aren\u2019t quite as vibrant as I hoped. They look kinda faded in person. It\u2019s also not as thick\u2014definitely not plush. It does the job, but I thought it\u2019d be more luxurious for the price. As for cleaning, it\u2019s alright, just sheds a bit when you vacuum,",

The customization options are cool, and I liked the variety of textures and patterns available, but when the rug arrived in my digital space, the quality felt a bit off. \n\nSome textures don\u2019t look very realistic, which is kind of disappointing. Also, it\u2019s not super easy to navigate through all the choices; sometimes I felt overwhelmed. The rendering took a bit long too",

The variety of textures is definitely appealing, but some of them feel a bit too similar. I expected to see more unique designs when scrolling through. \n\nIt was fun to set up initially, but after a bit, I felt that the experience got a bit repetitive. The realistic feel of the rugs looked great on-screen, but in terms of personalizing my virtual space, it didn\u2019t",
