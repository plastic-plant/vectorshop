The texture is nice, too\u2014feels soft underfoot, which is great for lounging around. I was a bit worried about it shedding, but surprisingly, there hasn\u2019t been much of that at all.\n\nCleaning it is also not a hassle. A simple vacuum does the trick, and occasionally steam cleaning helps it look fresh. The only thing is that I wish",

Het ontwerp is mooi en past perfect in mijn woonkamer. \n\nDe kleuren zijn levendig, maar misschien iets minder fel dan ik had verwacht. Een klein minpuntje is dat stof en haren zich makkelijk hechten aan het kleed, dus regelmatig hobbelen met de stofzuiger is wel aan te raden. \n\nMaar",

It adds a nice pop to my decor, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of compliments from friends.\n\nInstallation was a breeze, I laid it out and it flattened out quickly with no odd creases. It feels good underfoot, not too plush but comfortable enough for everyday use. \n\nThe only reason I\u2019m not giving it a full five stars is because it does",

The colors are vibrant and exactly what I was looking for! It feels good underfoot too, not too soft or too hard. One minor thing is it does shed a bit at first, but it seems to be getting better with time.\n\nI also appreciate how easy it is to clean\u2014just a quick vacuum and it looks as good as new!",
