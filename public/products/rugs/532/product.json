            "review": "I ordered one of these rugs expecting something cozy and inviting. The design is cute and seems well-thought-out, but honestly, the material feels a little rougher than I hoped. I was picturing something plush, but it\u2019s more on the thin side. It looks pretty in the living room, but I find myself constantly adjusting it because it slides around too much on my hardwood floors. It keeps getting swept up from under the coffee table. It\u2019s not the worst buy ever, but definitely",

However, it's not very soft underfoot, which is disappointing because I was hoping for a cozy feel. \n\nIt's also not very thick, so it slides around a bit on my hardwood floor, which can be annoying. I have to keep adjusting it, and I worry about it being a tripping hazard. \n\nIt's easy to clean",

            "review": "Ik heb onlangs deze vloerkleden gekocht en ze zijn in elk geval leuk om te zien, maar niet geweldig in het gebruik. De kleuren zijn levendig en het ontwerp is uniek, echt een praatpunten in de kamer. Maar de stof voelt toch een beetje ruw aan onder de voeten en ik had gehoopt dat ze wat zachter zouden zijn. Ze glijden ook makkelijk over de vloer, dus je moet altijd opletten dat je niet struikelt. Het onderhoud is ook niet zo simpel",
