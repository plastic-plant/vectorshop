The colors are nice and it does add some style to the room, but the texture isn\u2019t as soft as I\u2019d hoped. Feels a little scratchy underfoot, especially if you're walking barefoot. Cleaning it is also a hassle; it collects dirt easily and doesn't seem to hold up in the wash. I expected better for the price, but it hasn't completely ruined my space or anything",

The design is pretty, and it did brighten up the room. However, I expected it to be softer underfoot, and honestly, it's a little rougher than I imagined. It also slides around a bit on my hardwood floors, which can be annoying. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to clean, so that\u2019s a plus.",

I thought it would feel cozy underfoot, but it\u2019s kinda scratchy. Also, it sheds a bit, which is annoying since I find little fibers everywhere. It holds up okay with vacuuming, but I think the quality could be better for the price. If you\u2019re looking for something pretty to look at,",

The colors are pretty nice, but the texture feels a bit rough underfoot compared to what I expected. It\u2019s not the coziest rug to walk on, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nIt does stay in place fairly well, so no slipping issues there, which is great. I noticed a little shedding at first too, but that\u2019s slowly getting better. It\u2019s definitely an attractive piece though, and",
