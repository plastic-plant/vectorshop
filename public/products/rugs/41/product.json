            "review": "Ik heb deze vloerbedekking nu een paar weken in huis en ik ben een beetje verdeeld. De kleur is mooi en hij voelt aangenaam aan, maar er zijn ook een paar minpunten. Hij is niet zo stevig als ik had gehoopt, en na een tijdje liggen er al redelijk wat kreukels in. Ook vind ik dat de textuur niet zo mooi is als op de afbeelding. Hij verslijt eigenlijk vrij snel, wat echt jammer is. Ik verwachtte meer voor de prijs",

The texture is nice and it feels soft underfoot, which is great for lounging around, but it also sheds quite a bit, and I find myself vacuuming more often than I\u2019d like. The design is beautiful, adding some character to the space, but I noticed some minor fraying at the edges after just a month. It's not terrible, but it doesn\u2019t seem",

The texture is pretty soft underfoot, so that\u2019s a plus. \n\nHowever, itdoesn\u2019t seem to hold up well to daily traffic. There are already some visible wear marks, and I find that it gets dirty pretty quickly. Also, the edges started curling a bit after just a few days, which is annoying.",

The texture feels nice underfoot, but the colors aren\u2019t as vibrant as I thought they\u2019d be. They\u2019re a bit dull, which kinda dampens the whole vibe of my room. It also tends to slide around a lot on my hardwood floors; I have to constantly adjust it. I expected a little more stuff for the money. It looks decent, but it's not really impressing me",
