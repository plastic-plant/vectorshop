It feels soft underfoot, and I love walking on it with bare feet. The material seems durable and easy to clean, which is a big plus for me since I have a couple of pets.\n\nOne little downside is that it did shed a bit at first, but that's expected with new rugs. After a few vacuuming sessions,",

It\u2019s soft underfoot and seems to hold up well to daily use. \n\nI did notice that it could shed a little bit at first, so keep a lint roller handy. But honestly, that's just a minor setback. It adds a nice pop without feeling overwhelming, and I love how it ties my decor together.",

It feels soft underfoot, and I can tell it\u2019s made well\u2014definitely not cheap materials. \n\nI was worried about shedding, but so far it\u2019s minimal, which is a huge plus! The design is unique and cozy, perfect for curling up with a book. My only complaint is that it took a bit longer to arrive",
