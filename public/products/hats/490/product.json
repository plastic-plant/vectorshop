It doesn\u2019t block the sun like it says, and it looks kinda silly. Mine fell apart after a few wears. Not worth the money at all. I would not recommend it to anyone. Super disappointed here.",

The material is so thin, I thought it would tear just from putting it on. Plus, the color is totally off from what I expected\u2014it looked better in the picture. \n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the design! It looks goofy and dated, like something you'd find in a clearance bin. I really thought this would be a nice addition",

It almost gave me a headache wearing it for more than 10 minutes. The design looked cool online, but in person, it looks nothing like the pics. The color faded after one wash. Waste of money, seriously. Wish I could give it zero stars.",

I tried to wear it outside once and it was so uncomfortable. The visor does nothing to block the sun either. Completely useless. I\u2019m regretting buying this. Would not recommend to anyone. Waste of money for sure!",
