However, after wearing it for a few hours, it gets a bit uncomfortable, and I wish the fabric was softer. Plus, the color options feel kinda limited; I was hoping for more variety. It's nice for casual outings, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite accessory. I guess it works for the price, but I expected a bit more. Overall",

The fit is a bit off \u2013 kind of tight around the sides but loose in the front. I've worn it a few times but I find myself adjusting it quite a lot. Quality is decent, but I've seen better at this price point. If you're looking for something stylish, it sort of does the job, but don't expect it to be your go",

Les mat\u00e9riaux sont assez moyens, je m'attendais \u00e0 quelque chose de plus qualitatif \u00e0 vrai dire. Les couleurs sont sympas, mais la finition laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Il fait le job, mais je ne suis pas s\u00fbr si je le recommanderais \u00e0 des amis. Peut-\u00eatre que j'aur",
