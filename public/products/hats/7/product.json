The material isn't great\u2014it doesn't breathe at all and just gets sweaty. The sizing is off too; it\u2019s way too tight for me, even though I ordered the size I usually wear.\n\nThe color options are nice, but that's about the only thing I liked. I hoped it would look really stylish, but it just doesn\u2019t sit right. I tried adjusting",

O material parece barato e a compara\u00e7\u00e3o com outros bon\u00e9s que tenho \u00e9 bem frustrante. Fica meio frouxo na cabe\u00e7a e n\u00e3o segura bem. Al\u00e9m disso, depois de algumas lavagens, a cor come\u00e7ou a desbotar. Achei que seria mais confort\u00e1vel, mas me deixou suando um pouco. Para o pre\u00e7o, esperava mais qualidade. N\u00e3o sei se recomendo.",

It feels tight in some spots and lose in others, which is super uncomfortable for long wear. Also, the material is not what I expected, kinda cheap feeling. The color options are nice, but honestly, I\u2019d rather have something basic that fits right. For the price, I expected better quality. I\u2019d say only consider this if you really",
