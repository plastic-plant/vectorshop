The fit feels weird, a bit too tight on the sides and loose on top - not sure how that\u2019s even possible. The material is okay, but it kinda feels flimsy, like it might just tear if you wear it too much. The shading is decent, but when it gets windy, it blows off easily. I wanted something I'd wear all the time, but I can",

Al\u00e9m disso, ele n\u00e3o se ajusta bem na cabe\u00e7a; \u00e9 muito apertado e desconfort\u00e1vel, mesmo ap\u00f3s usos. A prote\u00e7\u00e3o solar \u00e9 boa, mas n\u00e3o vale a pena pelo pre\u00e7o pago. Outros chap\u00e9us fazem o trabalho melhor e s\u00e3o mais confort\u00e1veis. N\u00e3o recomendo se voc\u00ea procura algo pr\u00e1tico e de qual",
