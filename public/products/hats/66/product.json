Felt like it could just blow away in the wind. Plus, the colors are all wrong \u2013 totally dull and cheap. Tried to wear it out but felt ridiculous. Seriously should\u2019ve read the other reviews before buying. Do not recommend! \ud83d\udca9",

The fit is awful, it's super uncomfortable\u2014feels like it\u2019s digging into my head! The material is cheap and flimsy, not worth the price at all. Tried to return it but the process is such a hassle. Avoid this if you can! 1 star for sure.",

The material is super cheap too, started to fray after just one wear. The design looks cute in pics, but in real life it just looks silly on me. I tried to adjust it, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nIt\u2019s not worth the money at all. Would not recommend. Save your cash",
