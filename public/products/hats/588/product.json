The top part can be a bit awkward to adjust, and sometimes it doesn't stay in place when I'm out walking. It\u2019s great for sun protection and I appreciate that, but it\u2019s a bit heavier than I expected. I feel like for the price, there could be better options out there. Definitely not a bad purchase, but I wouldn",

First off, the design is pretty stylish and it does provide decent coverage from the sun. However, the fit is somewhat awkward. It tends to slip and doesn\u2019t sit as well as I hoped, especially if I'm out for a long time. \n\nThe material feels a bit cheap for the price\u2014like it\u2019s not going to hold up very",

The design is stylish, and I do get a few compliments when I wear it, but functionally, it just kind of falls short. The fabric feels a bit cheap and not as durable as I hoped. \n\nI was looking for something that would really block the sun well, but it seems to only do a so-so job at that. The fit is also not perfect; it tends to slip around a",

Aunque tiene un dise\u00f1o atractivo y protege del sol, tiene un inconveniente: no se ajusta muy bien y a veces se mueve al viento. Me gusta la variedad de colores, pero sinceramente, no me convence del todo. Lo uso de vez en cuando, pero no ser\u00eda mi opci\u00f3n principal. Funciona, pero",
