The material feels a bit cheaper than expected, and it doesn't fit as snugly as I'd hoped. On sunny days, it provides decent shade, but when there\u2019s wind, it tends to blow off easily. I find myself adjusting it way too often! I also wish there were more color options. Overall, it's okay but didn't totally live up",

The material feels nice at first, but I found it a bit too tight on my head after wearing it for a while. The designs are cool, but not as many options as I\u2019d hoped for. Also, I was expecting better sun protection, but it doesn\u2019t really cover everything. It\u2019s decent for a casual outing, but I wouldn\u2019t choose it for long",

The design is nice, and it looks good at first glance, but then you wear it for a while and it starts to get a bit uncomfortable. I wish the materials were softer or something since it scratches my forehead after a few hours. It keeps the sun out decently, though, and it's light enough for summer wear. Just wasn\u2019t what I expected overall. It\u2019s a solid option if you really need a hat, but",

O design at\u00e9 que \u00e9 bonito e ele parece bem feito, mas n\u00e3o achei t\u00e3o confort\u00e1vel. A aba \u00e9 um pouco r\u00edgida e machuca minha cabe\u00e7a depois de usar por um tempo. Al\u00e9m disso, a ventila\u00e7\u00e3o podia ser melhor, porque normalmente fico com a cabe\u00e7a quente. \u00c9 ok pra quem busca algo mais estiloso do que pr\u00e1tico, mas esperava um",
