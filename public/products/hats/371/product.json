The material feels decent enough and it does a good job blocking the sun, which is a must for me. \n\nHowever, I found it just a bit tight around the head, even after adjusting. Not the most comfortable for long wear. The design is nice, but it could be improved with a few more color options. Also, it has",

However, I found the fit kinda shaky; it slips a bit when I lean down or move a lot. The material feels decent, but I was hoping for something a bit more durable. I\u2019ve worn it a few times now, and while it does offer some shade, I still find myself squinting sometimes. Style-wise,",

The design is nice, but it feels a bit loose on my head, making it a bit frustrating when the wind picks up. I like the color options, too, but after a couple of wears, it started to lose its shape. It\u2019s decent for short outings, but for long days outside, I need something more reliable. Overall",

Mais apr\u00e8s l'avoir port\u00e9 plusieurs fois, je suis un peu d\u00e9\u00e7u. Le tissu n'est pas aussi respirant que je l'esp\u00e9rais, et les coutures commencent \u00e0 montrer des signes d'usure plus t\u00f4t que pr\u00e9vu. Il offre une bonne protection contre le soleil, mais il reste un peu lourd \u00e0 porter.",
