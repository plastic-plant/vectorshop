The material feels cheap and itchy, really uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes. Got bad vibes just wearing it! The color wasn\u2019t even what it looked like online, so that\u2019s just false advertising. Also, the shape? Just weird. I liked the style but too many flaws. Overall I wouldn\u2019t recommend it at all",

Looked way better online. There\u2019s no way I'm wearing this out. I tried to adjust it but no luck. Seriously regretting this purchase. What a waste of money! Don\u2019t buy it!",
