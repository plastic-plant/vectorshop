Yeah, that\u2019s a myth. I\u2019ve had it spill all over my bag more times than I can count. Also, the insulation doesn\u2019t hold up like it should; drinks don\u2019t stay cold for long, and warm water is not what I want. I expected more for the price. Overall, it",

I\u2019ve had wet backpacks more than once now. The design is sleek, but that\u2019s about it - it doesn't hold temperature for very long either, at least not like they claim. I was hoping for cold water during the summer, but it\u2019s lukewarm after a few hours. Also, the mouthpiece is kind of hard",

The design looks nice, but it feels kinda flimsy\u2014like it\u2019s gonna break any minute. The cap doesn't seal properly, so I've had some leaks in my bag. Not what I wanted, especially when I\u2019m on the go. Sure, it keeps drinks cool for a little while, but then it just kinda warms up too quickly. Could also use a bigger opening for ice.",

First off, it claims to keep water cold for hours, but I found it only stays cold for a little over an hour. Not exactly what I expected. Also, the lid is hard to screw on properly, like it never feels tight enough. A couple of times I thought I had it sealed and it leaked in my bag - super annoying.
