The lid doesn\u2019t seal properly, and I noticed leaks after just a day! Not cool. Also, it\u2019s heavy even when it\u2019s empty, which is kind of annoying if you want to carry it around.\n\nI've found myself reaching for my old bottle instead. The colors and design are great,",

I tried to carry it in my bag, and I had to clean up a mess every time I took it out. The design looks nice, but it feels a bit flimsy.

The design is nice and all, but the functionality is lacking. It leaks every time I tilt it a bit, which is super annoying when trying to carry it around. The cap feels cheap and doesn't fit securely. I also noticed that the materials used don't keep the water cool for long, which is disappointing on hot days. I expected more for the price.
