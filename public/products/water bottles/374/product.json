I kept my drinks in it and opened it just a bit, and then boom \u2013 my bag was soaked. The straw was so hard to suck from too, like I was working out just to get water. Plus, it\u2019s really hard to clean, got gunk stuck everywhere. Not sturdy at all, dropped it once and got a huge dent. Really disappointed \u2013 don",

            "review": "this water bottle is honestly terrible. first off it leaks everywhere, i can't even put it in my bag without it soaking everything. then the lid feels cheap and doesn't close properly. i thought it would keep my drink cold but it\u2019s barely better than room temp. also, super hard to clean, the mouth is so small i cant even get my hand in there. waste of money for sure. do not recommend at all.",
