On one hand, it keeps my water cool for a decent amount of time, which is great for outdoor activities. However, it has a lot of design flaws that really annoy me. \n\nThe lid isn\u2019t very secure \u2013 it sometimes leaks if I tilt it, which isn't fun when it's in my bag. I also find the mouth opening a bit small for filling it up easily. The convenience factor",

On the plus side, it\u2019s designed well and looks nice. The colors are fun, and it\u2019s definitely lightweight, so carrying it around isn\u2019t a hassle. \n\nHowever, I expected it to keep my drinks cold for longer. It cools them down, but not as long as I\u2019d like. Plus, I found the opening a bit small for ice",

The design is pretty sleek and it fits in my car cup holder perfectly. \n\nHowever, I found some issues with it the first few days.
