Hard to clean and the cap doesn\u2019t screw on right. Super flimsy, feels cheap. Tried to contact support but no response. Totally regret buying this, not worth the money. Save your cash and look for something better.",

The plastic feels cheap and flimsy. Tried to drink from it and it just made a mess, water spilling everywhere. Also, it doesn\u2019t keep my drink cold for long. So frustrating. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone. Save your money!",

La qualit\u00e9 est vraiment pas l\u00e0, la matiere semble cheap. J\u2019essaie de rester hydrat\u00e9, mais avec \u00e7a c\u2019est pas possible. Vraiment d\u00e9\u00e7u, je ne recommande pas du tout.",
