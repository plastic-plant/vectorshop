Pens\u00e9 que seria mucho mejor por el precio que pague, pero es un brutto error. No lo recomiendo, guardad vuestro dinero.",

The cap is super hard to screw on and off. Sometimes I just can\u2019t get the water out at all \u2013 like it\u2019s stuck. It's way heavier than I thought too, not convenient for carrying around. \n\nAnd honestly, I thought it would keep my drink cold but it doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference",

Super disappointed. Also, the plastic feels really cheap, not what I expected at all. I don\u2019t get the hype, maybe I got a bad one but just no good experience. Goes straight to the trash for me. Don\u2019t waste your money.",

I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone.",
