The design is nice and it feels good in hand, but it's not as leak-proof as I hoped it would be. I\u2019ve had a couple of spills when I forget to close it tightly. Also, while it\u2019s made from sustainable materials, it can be a bit of a pain to clean deep inside where the cap screws on.\n\nThe insulation works decent enough for short trips,",

But honestly, the material feels a bit cheap to me and it\u2019s not as durable as I expected. Sometimes it leaks a little, which is annoying, especially when I toss it in my bag.

It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s eco-friendly, but honestly, it doesn\u2019t feel as durable as I expected. The design is sleek, but the cap sometimes leaks a little if it\u2019s not screwed on just right. I like the size and it fits in my bag well, but I\u2019ve had better bottles for the price. The insulation works okay, but not impressive. All in all, it's",
