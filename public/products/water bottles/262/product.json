The insulation really keeps my water cold for hours, which is a huge plus! I've dropped it a couple of times, and it still looks as good as new, so it feels pretty durable.\n\nThe flip-top lid is pretty convenient, but sometimes it can be a bit hard to open with one hand. Also, I wish it had a bigger opening",
