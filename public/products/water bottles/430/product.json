The design is sleek and the idea of a built-in filtration system seemed great, but it's just not practical. The bottle feels flimsy and I'm worried it won\u2019t last. After a few uses, I noticed it leaks from the lid, which is a real bummer. The filter part is hard to clean and just gets gunky. \n\nIt takes up too much space in my bag, and it\u2019s not as",
