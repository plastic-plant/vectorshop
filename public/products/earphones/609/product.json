Really uncomfortable too. I gave \u2019em multiple tries, but nothing changed. I just can\u2019t believe the reviews were good. Majorly disappointing. Don\u2019t waste ur money.

A \u00fanica coisa que gostei foi a cor, mas isso adianta nada. Fiquei decepcionado total, j\u00e1 tinha ouvido coias melhores. N\u00e3o vale o pre\u00e7o. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I would not recommend. just don\u2019t buy them.",

La bater\u00eda dura muy poco, siempre tengo que recargarlos. Adem\u00e1s, son inc\u00f3modos, me duelen las orejas despu\u00e9s de un rato. No los recomendar\u00eda a nadie. Solo me he llevado una gran decepci\u00f3n.",
