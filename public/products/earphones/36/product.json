The sound quality is decent, but I was hoping for something a bit richer. Sometimes the bass just sounds a little flat. \n\nThe design is nice and comfy to wear for long periods, at least, but I did notice the battery doesn\u2019t last as long as expected. It\u2019s frustrating when I want to use them for a whole day, and I have to charge them up",

The sound quality is decent; it\u2019s clear enough for music and podcasts, but I expected more bass. Sometimes they struggle with volume too\u2014there are times when cranking up the sound just doesn\u2019t deliver that punch I want.\n\nComfort-wise, they fit well in my ears for short sessions, but longer usage can be a bit uncomfortable.

Sometimes, the audio can feel a little flat, especially with music that should really hit you in the chest. They\u2019re comfortable enough to wear for a while, but after a few hours, they start to hurt my ears a bit.\n\nThe noise-canceling feature works okay, but I can still hear some background",

The sound quality is decent, but honestly, I expected a bit more clarity for the price. It's nice when listening to music, but sometimes voices sound a little muffled. \n\nComfort-wise, they are alright for short listens, but I find myself adjusting them every now and then. They've also got decent battery life, which is a plus, but the connection can drop occasionally if",

They fit well in my ears, but sometimes they feel loose when I\u2019m moving around, which is kinda annoying. Battery life is just alright too; I wish it lasted longer. \n\nThe touch controls are convenient, but they can be a bit sensitive, and I find myself accidentally pausing or changing songs by mistake.",
