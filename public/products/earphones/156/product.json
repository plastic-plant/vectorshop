I mean, it\u2019s fine for casual listening or when I\u2019m at the gym, but I expected a bit more clarity, especially for the price. \n\nOn the plus side, they are lightweight and pretty comfortable, so wearing them for extended periods isn\u2019t a problem.

Sometimes I get a bit of background noise, which can be annoying when I\u2019m trying to enjoy my music or a podcast. The fit is decent, but they fall out a lot during workouts. \n\nBattery life is pretty average, nothing too impressive. I find myself charging them more often than I\u2019d like. The controls can be a bit finicky",

I expected more, especially with the hype around them. They fit fairly well, but after a while, they can get a bit uncomfortable, and the battery life could be better. I guess they work for casual listening or quick calls, but if you\u2019re really into music or long sessions, you might get disappointed. Sometimes they connect slowly",
