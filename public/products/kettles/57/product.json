It doesn\u2019t heat the water as fast as my old one did, and the temperature settings are kinda confusing to use. I\u2019ve accidentally boiled water when I only wanted to steep my tea. The lid doesn\u2019t close well, so it sometimes splatters, which is not fun. Plus, the app connection is spotty; it drops out a lot and I end up having to reset it. I was hoping for",

Sometimes I\u2019ll make tea and it will be lukewarm, then other times it burns the water. The controls are confusing and not intuitive at all. I actually find myself hoping I don't have to use it. Can't even make a decent cup of coffee because of it. It looks good on the counter but underwhelming in performance.",

Some water boils quicker than others, and I often end up with cold spots. Also, the lid is tricky to close properly, which means it sometimes spills. It\u2019s not super easy to clean either, as the handle doesn\u2019t stay cool, so I have to be careful. I'm just not impressed. Thought it would be better with all the hype but honestly just disappointed.",

Filled it up for a few cups of tea, but it takes forever to boil, and when it does, the whistle is so weak you can barely hear it! The design looks nice, but it feels cheap. Also, good luck pouring without spilling everywhere\u2014it just doesn't have a good spout for it. Not impressed overall. I expected much more for the price, especially with so many gadgets at",
