But the design is kinda awkward, like the handle feels off and sometimes the spout doesn't pour right. A couple of times I've spilled water trying to fill my cup. Also, I expected the light feature to be cooler than it is, it\u2019s just kinda basic. Overall, not the worst kettle, but definitely not the best. Just average.",

The lid design is kinda awkward; it doesn\u2019t open smoothly, and sometimes it feels like it might break if I pull too hard. Also, the buttons take a bit to get used to\u2014it\u2019s not super intuitive. I like the compact size for my kitchen, but it could use a better",

The design is sleek and looks nice on my countertop, but I've found it doesn't boil water as quickly as I'd expected. It takes a little longer than my old kettle, which is somewhat frustrating if I'm in a hurry. Also, sometimes it just shuts off without me realizing, and I have to start over, which can be annoying.\n\nThe features are pretty cool like the temperature control, and the LED lights are",

On one hand, it heats up water really quickly which is great; I love being able to make tea or coffee without waiting too long. But, on the other hand, the spout isn't great \u2013 it tends to drip a bit when pouring, so I've had to deal with more spills than I\u2019d like. The design is sleek and modern, but the plastic handle feels a bit cheap and I'm worried",

The design looks modern, but honestly, it feels kind of plastic-y and cheap. The spout is okay, but sometimes I struggle pouring without splashing.
