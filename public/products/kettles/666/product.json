The temperature settings are a nice feature, but I've found them a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it takes longer than expected to boil water, and it can be really loud when it does. The design looks nice on my counter, but the spout can be a bit messy when pouring. I wish it was easier to clean the inside too. Overall, it's not bad, but",

The design looks nice and fits my kitchen, but sometimes the handle feels a bit flimsy. I\u2019ve also noticed it doesn\u2019t hold heat for very long, so if I get distracted, I have to heat it up again.\n\nThe smart features are a nice touch, but setting the temperature can be a",
