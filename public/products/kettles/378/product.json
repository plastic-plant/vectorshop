It looks nice on my counter, I\u2019ll give it that, but the functionality is just not there. The heating time is way longer than I expected, and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t get the water to the right temp. \n\nPlus, the pouring is a bit awkward. It spills more than I\u2019d like, which makes mornings pretty messy. The design is flashy, but it lacks that simple usability that",

            "review": "I was really excited to get this kettle, but honestly, I'm kinda disappointed. It looks nice, but it heats water pretty slowly, and a lot slower than my old one. I find myself waiting longer than I want just for a cup of tea. Plus, the whistle is not even that loud, I hardly hear it sometimes, which is frustrating when I'm in another room. The design is cool and all, but I expected it to work better for the price. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend if you",
