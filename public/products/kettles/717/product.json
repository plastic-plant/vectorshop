It takes a long time to get to boiling point, and I find myself waiting much longer than with my old kettle. Plus, the temperature settings are confusing. Sometimes it just doesn\u2019t seem to get to the right temperature, and I\u2019m left guessing when my tea will be ready. \n\nAlso, the design looks nice but it's a bit tricky to pour without",

It heats water quite slowly, which is frustrating when you're in a hurry. Also, the spout is awkward; it spills more than I expected when pouring. Cleaning it is another hassle, doesn't get rid of stains easily. I mean, for the price, I thought I\u2019d get something way better. Overall, not impressed and I wouldn\u2019t",

It doesn\u2019t heat up as fast as I thought it would either. Sometimes I end up waiting way longer for it to boil. \n\nAlso, the grip is kinda awkward.

First off, it takes forever to heat up, which can be super annoying when you\u2019re trying to make a quick cup of tea. Sometimes it just stops heating altogether, I\u2019ve had to unplug and replug it multiple times! \n\nThe design also feels kinda cheap, I expected better materials for the price I paid. And the pour spout, what a mess\u2014water spills everywhere, you",
