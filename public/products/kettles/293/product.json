The electrical cord is way too short, so I have to juggle it on the edge of my counter, which feels super unsafe. And the lid doesn't close properly, it's annoying. Sometimes it leaks water. I've had cheaper ones that work way better! Gonna return it for sure. Save your money, don\u2019t bother with this one.",
