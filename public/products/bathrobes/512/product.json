After just a few washes, it started to pill, which is disappointing. Also, the sizing is off - I ordered a large, and it fits more like a medium. It\u2019s not very cozy either, just feels like I\u2019m draped in a not-so-warm blanket. I expected way better for the price. It's just",

I expected something cozy to wrap up in after my showers, but instead it just scratches a bit. Also, the fit is strange. It's kind of tight in the shoulders but wide at the bottom? What\u2019s up with that? \n\nI bought this thinking it'd be good for lounging around at home, but it doesn\u2019t do a great job",

Used it after a shower, and it didn\u2019t absorb the water well at all. Also, it\u2019s way too loose\u2014it slips off my shoulders too easily. The fit is off, and it\u2019s not very flattering, which was disappointing. Overall, I\u2019ve had better robes for less money. It\u2019s okay, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend",

The material felt kinda scratchy, and it doesn\u2019t keep me warm at all. It looks nice but when I wear it, I just don't feel cozy like I do in my other bathrobes.

The fabric is softer than I expected, which is nice, but it feels thin and cheap. It doesn't keep me warm at all, and sometimes I wish I hadn\u2019t even bothered wearing it. The sizing is also off\u2014it's either too tight in the shoulders or way too loose everywhere else. \n\nI thought I would find it cozy to lounge around in, but instead, it just feels",
