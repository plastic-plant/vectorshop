It\u2019s way too tight around the arms and super baggy everywhere else. Just uncomfortable. Plus, I found a couple of loose threads right out of the packaging. I washed it once, now it looks like an old rag. Would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money.",

And the sizing is totally off; it doesn\u2019t wrap around me properly. The colors look nice, but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s like wearing a towel that won\u2019t even dry you off. Totally regret buying this. Save your money and find something better.",

The sizing is off too, I got a medium but its way too small. Got stuck trying to put it on and had to wrestle out of it! So not cool! The pockets are tiny, like you cant even fit your phone in them. Plus it doesn\u2019t even keep me warm, kept feeling chilly. I thought I was getting",
