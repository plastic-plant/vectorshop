The fabric feels soft enough, but it\u2019s surprisingly thin and not warm at all. I expected something luxurious but this just feels like a regular cotton robe you could get at a discount store. I found it doesn't absorb water well either, which is a bummer after a shower. The sizing is off too; the fit is a bit weird, and the sleeves are super long for me, just hanging",

I have other robes that are way cozier. It also doesn\u2019t fit right\u2014it\u2019s a bit too tight in the arms but loose everywhere else, making it really weird to wear.

The material feels cheaper than I expected, almost scratchy at times, which is pretty disappointing for the price. Also, the sizing is off; I got the large, but it seems more like a medium.
