            "review": "I bought this robe hoping for some cozy comfort but it\u2019s just awful. The fabric feels scratchy and not soft at all, like a cheap towel. The fit is really off too, it either swallows me or it's too tight. I thought I\u2019d be wrapped in a nice warm hug but instead I feel stiff and uncomfortable. Also, it constantly sheds little bits of fluff everywhere, drives me crazy! Not worth the money at all, super disappointed. Would not recommend.",

I expected something cozy but it's just not it. the size is off too. way too big in the wrong places and tight in others. every time I put it on it just looks frumpy. the colors are dull and ugly too. please dont waste your money on this one. it looks good online but in person? total",

It doesn't keep me warm at all and kinda sticks to my skin. Size is way off too! I got a large but it fits like a medium. The pockets are super small, can't even hold my phone. Also, it started shedding after one wash, now there\u2019s fuzz everywhere. Not worth the money, I\u2019m pretty upset with this purchase. Would not",

When I put it on, it just doesn't hang right - more like wearing a sad potato sack. Can't even wrap it properly around me, and forget trying to feel comfy. The color looked brighter online, but in person it's just bland. Really regretting this purchase. Definitely not worth any stars \ud83e\udd7a.",
