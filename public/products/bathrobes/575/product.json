It gets cold way too fast, and it doesn\u2019t do a good job at keeping me warm after a shower. The sizing is off too; I got the large hoping for some room to move, but it feels tighter than I\u2019d like. The pockets are pretty useless \u2013 they\u2019re way too small to hold anything without",

I expected it to be soft and cozy, but it's more of a letdown. Also, the sizing is off; it was too tight in the shoulders and loose everywhere else. Not the fit I was hoping for. I mean, come on, who wants to tug on their robe all the time? \n\nThe pockets are barely functional; they\u2019re so small I",

I thought it would be cozy, but it's kind of uncomfortable. The sizing is also off; it's either too tight or way too loose in places. Plus, the color options were misleading\u2014the shade I got was way duller than in the pictures. Not sure if I\u2019ll be using this too much. It seems like it could\u2019ve been really nice if",

The size didn\u2019t fit quite right either, it\u2019s either way too big in some areas or too snug in others. And what's up with the color? It looked way better in the pics. Disappointed it doesn\u2019t have any pockets, either \u2013 I always want to stash my phone or keys when I\u2019m relaxing. Had high hopes",
