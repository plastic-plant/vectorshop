I washed it once and now it looks old and faded. Sizing is off too, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t even bother. I'd sent it back if I could, but I just gave up. Save your money and look elsewhere!",

It gets super wrinkled after washing, and the fit is weird; it's either way too tight or way too big. The pockets are so small you can't fit anything in them. Definitely not worth the money I spent on it. Would not recommend to anyone. Just not good.",

            "review": "I regret buying this. The fabric feels cheap and scratchy against my skin, not cozy at all. It doesn't keep me warm either. I'm always cold after I put it on. Plus, the sizing is weird\u2014too tight in some areas and way too loose in others. The seams started coming apart after just a few washes. It's not even worth half the price I paid. Honestly, save your money and get something else. Total waste of time!",

Also, the color looks dull and not like the photos. It's like wearing a sad towel. Tried to return it, but that was another hassle. Not happy with my purchase at all. Would not recommend. Save your money!",
