It doesn\u2019t keep me warm either; kinda feels like wearing a paper towel. It started shedding lint everywhere after just one wash. The fit is off too\u2014too tight around the shoulders and way too long. Can\u2019t even walk properly in it. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Save your money.",

            "review": "This bathrobe is a total letdown. First off, the fabric is rough, not soft like I expected. It feels cheap and uncomfortable against my skin. Sizing is also off; it's way too tight around the shoulders but way too loose everywhere else. I can't even tie it properly without it slipping. Not cozy at all! After a couple of washings, it started to pill and just looks worn out. What a waste of money. Not recommending this to anyone. Super disappointed!",

The size is way off too\u2014way too small. I bought a large and it fits like a medium. After a few washes, the color faded a lot and it\u2019s pilling like crazy. I honestly thought it would be cozy but every time I wear it, I regret my choice. Really not worth the money. Would",

I thought it would be cozy but it's scratchy and not warm at all. the sizing is weird too, I got a large and it's still too tight in some places. total waste of money. seriously disappointed, won\u2019t buy again.",
