After a couple of washes, it started to look all frayed and worn out, like it\u2019s been years old. Also, the size isn\u2019t true to fit. I ordered a large and it felt more like a small. Super disappointing. I was hoping for something cozy but this is just a letdown. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",
