            "review": "Honestly, this handbag is a disaster. First of all, it looks nothing like the pics online. The color is off and it feels super cheap like it\u2019s gonna fall apart any minute. The straps are way too short and cut into my shoulder. Zero organization inside \u2013 I can barely fit my phone and keys without it getting lost. Tried to return it but customer service was awful. Save your money, seriously.",

            "review": "I really don\u2019t get why people are saying this is nice. I got it a month ago and it\u2019s falling apart already! The material feels cheap and it\u2019s so stiff, you can\u2019t even fit your stuff in here properly. The straps dug into my shoulders making it super uncomfortable to carry. Also, the color didn\u2019t even look like the picture. Worse purchase ever, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone. Save your money.",
