The material doesn\u2019t feel sturdy at all, and I worry it won't last very long. Also, the straps are a little uncomfortable; they dig into my shoulders when it's packed even a bit. \n\nThere\u2019s decent space inside, but the pockets are awkwardly placed, making it hard to organize my things.

The material seems cheap and it's not as roomy as I hoped. The straps aren\u2019t very comfortable either, they dig into my shoulders. It also doesn\u2019t hold its shape well when it\u2019s not full. I found myself wishing I\u2019d spent my money on something better. It looks nice but I want a bag that I can actually use without fuss",

After a week of using it, the stitching started to come apart. The inside has a few compartments but they're not very practical. It's hard to find stuff in there when I need it. I thought it would fit my everyday essentials, but it ends up looking stuffed and awkward. Also, the strap is super uncomfortable\u2014",
