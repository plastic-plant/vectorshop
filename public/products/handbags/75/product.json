Straps are way too long and it just doesn\u2019t sit right no matter how I adjust it. I thought it would be great for traveling but I can barely fit my stuff in. Not even close to what I expected smh. Definitely not recommend this to anyone!",

It doesn\u2019t hold its shape, so things get all messy inside. Comfort? Forget it. The strap digs into my shoulder. I can\u2019t even fit my laptop in without it looking super bulky. So disappointed, wish I hadn\u2019t bought it. It\u2019s just not worth the money at all. Don\u2019t recommend!",

I tried to stuff in my essentials but it just looks floppy and doesn't zip right. Plus, the strap digs into my shoulder, so carrying it for long isn't even possible. The pockets are way too small too, can't fit my phone in them! Save your money, this one's not worth it. I regret buying it. \ud83d\ude12",

Pas assez de place \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, impossible de mettre mes affaires correctement. Mang\u00e9, c'est presque impraticable ! Le poids est lourd pour un si petit sac. Et le style, franchement, on dirait un sac en plastique. Au top en pub, mais en vrai, pas du tout ! Une \u00e9toile c\u2019est trop.",
