The straps started to fray after just a few uses, which is a bummer. I mean, it\u2019s nice and light, but it doesn\u2019t hold much. If you\u2019re someone who likes to carry more than just your phone and wallet, this might not work for you. I guess I expected more for",

The straps feel flimsy and it lacks a little structure, so my things kind of flop around in there.\n\nAlso, the color I received was not at all like what I saw online, more dull than fab.

The material feels cheap, and I've already found a couple of loose threads after just a few uses. Also, the straps are uncomfortable\u2014they dig into my shoulders. I've had better luck with cheaper bags. I wouldn't recommend it, to be honest. It\u2019s just not worth the money. Disappointed.",

It looks nice at first, but I\u2019ve noticed the materials feel kinda cheap. After only a few weeks, the stitching is starting to come undone in a few places. I also thought there\u2019d be more room inside, but it feels cramped and with a laptop, it\u2019s a struggle to zip it up. Maybe it works for lighter stuff, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s practical if you",
