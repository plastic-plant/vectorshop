However, the quality feels a bit cheap, the material seems flimsy and I doubt it will hold up over time. Also, the pockets are kinda useless; they\u2019re not deep enough and things just slip out. Not to mention, the strap is way too thin and digs into my shoulder. I was hoping it would be my go-to bag",

La qualit\u00e9 du mat\u00e9riel n'est pas \u00e0 la hauteur et j'ai l'impression que la poign\u00e9e va se casser \u00e0 tout moment. J'ai aussi trouv\u00e9 que l'espace de rangement est un peu trop limit\u00e9 pour tous mes essentiels. La couleur est jolie mais ce n'est pas suffisant pour compenser les probl\u00e8mes. Je pensais vraiment que c'\u00e9tait un bon achat mais \u00e7a ne vaut pas vraiment",

The material feels cheap and flimsy, not at all what I expected. After a few weeks of use, I noticed some stitching coming undone. Not the durability I was looking for. \n\nThe space is decent but not as functional as I hoped. The pockets are placed weirdly, making it hard to grab what I need quickly.",

There\u2019s not enough room inside for my everyday stuff without things getting crammed and hard to find. Also, the material feels a bit cheap for the price. I was expecting something more luxe, but this feels more like a regular bag. Maybe it's okay if you don\u2019t need to carry much but seriously",

After just a few weeks of use, the stitching started coming undone, and I had to be super careful with how much I put in it. The straps are kind of flimsy too, which is frustrating because they dig into my shoulder when it's heavier. It's a nice size, but I doubt it will hold up with regular use. So yeah,",
