The color looked different online and doesn\u2019t match anything in my closet. Tried to use it for my daily stuff, and it\u2019s TOO small! like, seriously? I can\u2019t fit my phone and wallet in at the same time. The straps hurt my shoulders after just a few minutes. I thought I was getting a good deal but instead it feels like",
