            "review": "Honestly, I expected better. I got this umbrella hoping it would stand up to the wind and rain, but it flopped pretty hard. The design looks nice, and I thought the material felt sturdy at first. But when the rain started, it struggled to stay intact. The handle is also cheap and feels like it could break any minute. Plus, it\u2019s kinda heavy for what it is. Not the worst thing I\u2019ve owned, but definitely not worth the hype. Just okay in my books",

            "review": "I had high hopes for this umbrella, but it just didn't deliver. First off, it's really flimsy. The frame felt weak, and on a mildly windy day, it was practically turning inside out. The design is kind of cool, but it doesn't really matter when the function isn't there. The grip is uncomfortable too; I felt like I'd have include it to hold onto it formerills which was really annoying in heavy rain. I wasn\u2019t expecting the moon but something that holds up better would be",
