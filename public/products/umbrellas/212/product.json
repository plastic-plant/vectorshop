            "review": "this umbrella is awful. first time using it and it flipped inside out as soon as the wind picked up. like seriously?! what even is the point of having one that cant stand a little breeze? then it won't close properly after that, just get stuck. must be made from cheap materials. even the colors are dull. I'd rather get wet than use this again, total waste of money.",

            "review": "I bought this umbrella hoping for some good protection from the rain but what a letdown! It broke the first time I tried to use it in the wind. The handle feels cheap and wobbly. I thought I was getting a sturdy product, but it's like it was made to fall apart. Plus, it barely covers me when it's open. I'm drenched every time! So disappointed. Would not recommend honestly. Save your money!",
