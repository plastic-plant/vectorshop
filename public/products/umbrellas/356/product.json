The frame feels flimsy, and I already had issues with it flipping inside out during a light wind. The handle is super uncomfortable too; it hurts my hand after holding it for a while.

I thought it would withstand wind better, but it flipped inside out with just a light breeze. The design is nice, but come on, looks don't mean much if it doesn't hold up.
