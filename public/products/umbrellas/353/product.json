One little gust and it flipped inside out like a toy. Now it\u2019s left in the porch broken. The handle feels cheap and flimsy too, I\u2019m worried it'll break next time I use it. Not worth the money, seriously. I want my money back. I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Save your cash!",

It's supposed to be windproof but fliped upside down on the first gust! Not worth the money at all. I regret this purchase completely. Save your cash and look somewhere else.",
