It has a cool design, and I like the color, but I feel like it doesn\u2019t hold up very well in super windy conditions. A couple of times it flipped inside out, and putting it back is a bit of a hassle. The size is nice for covering two people, but it\u2019s kind of heavy to carry around. I wish it were easier to open and close, too \u2013 sometimes it gets stuck. Overall",

However, when it\u2019s open, it can feel a bit flimsy. I've had a couple of windy days where it almost turned inside out. The handle is comfortable, but I wish it had a better grip. \n\nWhat\u2019s nice is that it\u2019s lightweight, so I can easily carry it around in my bag, but",
