The design is pretty cool, and I love the idea of it catching clouds, but in reality, it feels a bit flimsy. Like, I wouldn't want to whip it out during heavy rain. It does look stylish though, so that\u2019s a plus. \n\nOpening it can be tricky sometimes; I actually had to wrestle with it once or twice. It\u2019s also a little",

It definitely looks cool and has a unique design, but that\u2019s pretty much where the excitement ends. \n\nThe automated opening feature is neat, but it doesn\u2019t always work perfectly; sometimes it jams.

The canopy does open pretty wide, which is nice if it\u2019s pouring. It also dries pretty quick, so that\u2019s a plus. But I expected a bit more considering the",

But after using it a few times, I have to say it's just okay. \n\nThe size is nice and it feels light, but the opening mechanism is a bit finicky. I often struggle to pop it open smoothly, and there have been times when it jammed. Also, I was expecting it to handle wind better, but I've had",
