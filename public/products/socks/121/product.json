Le tissu est doux et tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able sur la peau. La taille est parfaite et elles ne glissent pas, ce qui est un gros plus pour moi. Les couleurs sont vives et amusantes, j'adore le design original qui donne un petit peps \u00e0 ma tenue.\n\nCela dit, je les trouve un peu trop chaudes pour l'\u00e9t\u00e9,",

The colors and patterns are so fun \u2013 seriously, they brighten up any gloomy day. They fit snugly without being tight, which I really appreciate. Walking around the house is comfy, though I did notice they don't have as much grip on slippery floors compared to some other socks I\u2019ve tried.\n\nThey do keep my feet warm, which is exactly what I was looking for.

The designs are vibrant and fun, which always brings a smile to my face when I\u2019m slipping them on. \n\nThey stay up well and don\u2019t slide down my ankles, which is a plus when you\u2019re super busy during the day. I did notice that after a few washes, the colors remained bright and didn\u2019t fade,",
