En plus, les motifs sont super sympas et ajoutent une touche de fun \u00e0 ma tenue. La couleur reste belle apr\u00e8s plusieurs lavages, ce qui est un gros plus. Par contre, je trouve qu'elles prennent un peu plus de temps \u00e0 s\u00e9cher que pr\u00e9vu. Mais bon, \u00e7a ne g\u00e2che",

They also come in such fun colors and patterns that really brighten up my wardrobe. I don\u2019t have any slipping or bunching at all, which is a major plus. My only gripe would be that I wish they were a bit more durable \u2013 after a few washes, they seem to lose a bit of their elasticity. Still,",

I\u2019ve worn them for a few weeks now, and they hold up nicely in the wash too\u2014no weird shrinking or fluffballs. They\u2019re warm but breathable enough for the summer, which is a bonus. \n\nOnly thing I wish is that they came in more colors, but the selection they have is still decent. Overall, a solid buy! I\u2019d recommend them for daily wear.",
