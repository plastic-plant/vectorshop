They're comfortable for a while, but I\u2019ve noticed they start to slide down after a few hours, which is kind of annoying. They also don\u2019t seem to keep my feet as warm as I expected, especially on colder days. The fabric is decent but not the softest I\u2019ve used. I wish they had a bit more stretch and support.

They feel nice when you first put them on, definitely soft and comfy, but the cushioning doesn\u2019t last as long as I expected. The style is decent but not super exciting. They do keep my feet warm, which is a plus, but after washing a few times, they don\u2019t seem to hold their shape very well. They fit alright but could be a bit more snug around the arch.",

They feel soft at first, but after a few washes, they started to lose some of that plushiness and got a bit of pilling. The color options are nice, though, and they look good with a lot of outfits. They keep my feet warm but aren't super breathable, so my feet can get a little sweaty if",
