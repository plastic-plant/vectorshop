The material feels kind of cheap, and they don\u2019t stay up like they should. After wearing them for a day, they started to stretch out, and I found myself constantly pulling them up. The colors are nice, though, but that\u2019s not enough for a sock I can't trust. I wanted to love them, but it's just not working out for me. I think I'll",

I expected softness, but they\u2019re just okay\u2014not the cozy feel I was looking for. Plus, they pill like crazy after a few washes. It\u2019s not worth the price tag. I\u2019ll probably just wear them around the house instead of out. Not a total loss, but I doubt I\u2019d buy again.",

The comfort was okay at first, but after a few wears, they lost their softness and started feeling scratchy. And don\u2019t even get me started on the fit. They kept slipping down my ankle, which is so annoying. I expected better for the price I paid. Not sure I would recommend these.",
