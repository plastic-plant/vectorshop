Sometimes they slide down a bit, especially when I\u2019m moving around a lot. They\u2019re not terrible but I wouldn\u2019t rave about them. Maybe good for lounging but not for staying active.

However, after a couple of washes, they started to lose their colors and softness. Also, the fit is a bit off. They\u2019re kinda tight around the middle but loose at the top, so it\u2019s a weird combo. I expected more for the price. I suppose they\u2019re fine for wearing around the house, but I wouldn't recommend them for",

They fit well initially, but after a couple of washes, I noticed they started to lose their shape a bit. \n\nThe material feels nice and soft on my feet, but they don't keep their warmth as nicely as I'd hoped.

They come in some fun colors and patterns, but the material feels a bit thin. I've noticed they started to show signs of wear after only a few washes. The comfort level is fair, but I was kind of expecting more. They do keep my feet warm, but I wouldn't say they are the greatest I\u2019ve tried. So yeah, not bad",
