            "review": "I was really looking forward to these socks, but they kinda missed the mark. First off, they feel a bit rough. I expected buttery softness, but instead, I got that scratchy feel. They also don\u2019t stay up well; I found myself pulling them up way too often while wearing them. Plus, the patterns are cute, but they started to fade after a few washes, which is disappointing. Overall, these socks are just okay, probably wouldn\u2019t buy again.",

            "review": "I wanted to love these, but honestly, they just missed the mark. The design is kinda fun, but after a few washes, they lost their color and started to fray. They don\u2019t stay up on my calves either; I found myself adjusting them all day. Not super comfy either, a bit scratchy against my skin. I expected more for the price. Definitely not the best socks I\u2019ve tried. Might work for some, but I won\u2019t be getting them again.",
