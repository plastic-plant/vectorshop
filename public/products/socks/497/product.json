Sie rutschen st\u00e4ndig und sind viel zu d\u00fcnn. hab gedacht, die w\u00e4ren bequem, aber das sind sie gar nicht! ich hab gleich zwei paare gekauft und das war ein Fehler. nach dem waschen sehen die total verbeult aus und der stoff pillt. f\u00fchlt sich an wie gezogener stoff von einem alten teetuch. w\u00fcrd ich niemandem empfehlen, ein geschenk f\u00fcr mich selbst war auch dumm\u1438image\u27e9",

Not warm at all, my feet were freezing! Plus, the fit is super weird\u2014super loose at the top but tight at the toes. Really disappointing. I can't believe people give this a good rating. Save your cash!",

They slip down constantly and get all bunched up, it\u2019s so annoying. And the material feels cheap and scratchy, not cozy like I thought. After one wash, they started to pill and look terrible. Can\u2019t believe I wasted my money on these. Never buying again. Ugh!",

Super desconfort\u00e1veis, parece que est\u00e3o sempre grudando na pele. A cor desbotou depois da primeira lavagem, e o tecido n\u00e3o tem resist\u00eancia. N\u00e3o compensa o pre\u00e7o. Definitivamente n\u00e3o recomendo, s\u00f3 uma perda de dinheiro e tempo. Melhor comprar em outro lugar.",
