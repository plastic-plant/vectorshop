They slip down my heel when I wear them, which is super annoying. I had to keep pulling them up all day! Plus, the material feels kinda cheap, not soft and cozy like I expected. They kinda lose shape after a wash too. I mean, they\u2019re okay for lounging around the house, but I wouldn\u2019t wear",

Super annoying when you're trying to move around! Also, the fabric didn't feel as soft as I expected it to be; kinda scratchy after wearing them all day. Plus, they lost their shape after one wash.

The design looked cool, but the fit was kind of weird; they don't stay up and just slide down my legs all the time. I've tried washing them a couple of times hoping they'd shape up, but nope. Plus, they feel kinda scratchy after a while. For the price, I expected better quality. Not really worth the hype, honestly. Just average socks that I wouldn't recommend if",

The comfort level is average at best\u2013 after a few hours, they start to slide down and bunch up weirdly. Plus, they don\u2019t keep my feet warm like I imagined they would. I\u2019ve also noticed they snag easily and some threads are coming loose after only a couple of washes. I mean, I was excited to wear",
