I tried to set it up but the instructions made no sense. Had to guess half of what to do. Didn\u2019t even fit all my stuff, way too small. The height isn\u2019t right, can\u2019t get comfy at all. I've used it for a week and I just want to throw it out. Do not buy!",

A montagem foi um pesadelo, as pe\u00e7as n\u00e3o encaixam direito, e faltou at\u00e9 parafusos! Al\u00e9m disso, ele balan\u00e7a muito, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel trabalhar assim. Achei que seria pr\u00e1tico, mas acabou sendo uma grande perda de dinheiro. N\u00e3o recomendo pra ningu\u00e9m, poupem seu dinheiro!",
