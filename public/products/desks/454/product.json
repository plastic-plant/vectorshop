Sometimes it feels a bit wobbly when you have stuff on it, like my monitors. The surface is nice to write on, but it scratches kinda easy. \n\nAssembly was alright, not too hard but missing a couple of screws. Customer service was decent though when I called about that.

A montagem n\u00e3o foi t\u00e3o complicada, mas os materiais parecem um pouco fr\u00e1geis, especialmente as partes de pl\u00e1stico. N\u00e3o d\u00e1 para ficar muito tempo em p\u00e9 porque a estabilidade \u00e9 question\u00e1vel \u00e0s vezes. O ajuste de altura funciona, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o suave quanto eu esperava. A sensa\u00e7\u00e3o geral \u00e9 que \u00e9 mais uma op\u00e7\u00e3o intermedi\u00e1ria. Fez o trabalho, mas n\u00e3o me deixa totalmente",

The adjustment feature is nice, but it\u2019s a bit wobbly when fully extended, which kinda defeats the purpose. Setup was not too hard, but the instructions could be clearer \u2013 I ended up with some leftover screws that I\u2019m still not sure about. \n\nThat said, the surface area is decent and has plenty of space for my monitor and laptop. It looks pretty sleek, too. Just wish",

On one hand, the height adjustable feature is nice; I can easily switch between sitting and standing throughout the day. It does help with my back, I guess. \n\nHowever, I expected a bit more stability. When I'm typing at standing height, the desk wobbles quite a bit which can be distracting. Also, the assembly was not the easiest \u2013 the instructions were a bit vague and it",
