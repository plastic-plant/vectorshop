Had to run to the store just to finish putting it together. It wobbles too, can't even put my laptop without it shaking everywhere. Totally not worth the money. I wish I'd read the bad reviews before buying. Save your cash and look for something else.",

The holes didn't line up right so I had to force stuff, which I hate. It wobbles too much even on a flat surface and there\u2019s no way to make it stable. I've had a headache just trying to use it for work. Not worth the money at all. Save yourself the trouble! Just don\u2019t bother getting this one!",

            "review": "Echt waardeloos. De kwaliteit is zo slecht, de lades zitten vast en het is allemaal zo dun dat ik bang ben dat het in elkaar zakt. Krijg het niet goed in elkaar, de instructies zijn onduidelijk. Geen plek om mn spullen neer te leggen en het krast echt overal. Geen aanrader, 1 ster voor deze troep.",

            "review": "I was really excited when I got this desk, but boy was I disappointed. The assembly was a nightmare, parts didn't fit right and the instructions were almost useless. Once I finally got it together, it was wobbly and felt super cheap. Could barely fit my laptop and the surface scratches really easily. I expected something way better for the price. Honestly, I've had the worst experience. Can't recommend this at all. Total waste of money.",
