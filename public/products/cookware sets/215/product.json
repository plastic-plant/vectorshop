            "review": "These pots and pans are just awful. I thought I was getting a good deal, but they burn everything! I can't even make scrambled eggs without them sticking. The handles get super hot, and you\u2019ve gotta use an oven mit just to pick them up. Also, they scratch really easily. I've only used them a couple times and already have deep marks on the surface. Not worth the money at all! Definitely regret buying this set. Avoid it if you like cooking anything decent.",

The handles are cheap plastic, and they started melting after just a few uses. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I expected way better quality. It\u2019s not even worth the price, it\u2019s just rubbish. I regret buying it and will be tossing this set in the trash. Save your money, folks.",

They don\u2019t heat evenly at all \u2014 some stuff burnt while other parts didn't cook. Seriously wasted my time making a simple meal. The handles get super hot too, feels dangerous to me. I\u2019ve had better luck with my old stuff! Not worth the money; you can find way better Chef-level products. 1 star all",
