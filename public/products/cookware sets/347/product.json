Cooked some eggs, and they stuck so bad! I ended up using a ton of oil just to avoid a mess. The handles feel loose, like they're gonna break off any second. I thought it would be easy to clean, but even with soaking, I couldn't get the stains off. Not worth the money at all. Save yourself the trouble and look",

I expect my pans to last longer than just a few uses. they also took forever to heat up, I'm not waiting around forever to cook. super disappointed. never buying again",

Se calientan de manera desigual, algunas partes cocinan m\u00e1s que otras. No se pegan, dicen, pero todo se queda pegado. La comida se arruina y se me quema todo. Adem\u00e1s parecen de juguete, muy baratas. Muy decepcionado, no recomiendo.",

            "review": "I regret buying this cookware set. At first glance it looks okay but after a few uses, it started to scratch and the non-stick part wears off. The pots heat unevenly, so my meals come out weird. I followed the instructions for care, but everything just seems to burn. Clean up is a nightmare. They might be cheap, but you get what you pay for. Save your money and look for something better. Not happy at all with this. Just plain disappointed.",
