The design is pretty nice, and it looks good in my kitchen, but there are some issues that are hard to ignore. The non-stick coating works okay \u2013 not the best, but it gets the job done most of the time. \n\nI found that it heats evenly, which is great for things like saut\u00e9ing veggies. But, I\u2019ve also noticed some scratches developing after just a few uses, and",

The nonstick feature is kinda hit or miss. Sometimes things stick more than I expected, which is really frustrating. The heat distribution isn\u2019t the best either; I\u2019ve burned a few meals because the pots and pans don't heat evenly.\n\nOn the positive side, they're fairly lightweight, making them easy to handle, and they clean",

The design looks great and the colors are a fun touch, but the performance is just okay. The pots heat up nicely, but I found that they can stick if you're not really careful with the temperature and the oil. \n\nCleaning is also a mixed bag; some pieces come clean easily while others seem to need a bit more scrubbing, which can be frustrating.

On one hand, the design is quite nice and looks good in my kitchen, but on the other hand, I found some aspects a bit underwhelming. \n\nThe non-stick surface works alright, but I did notice some sticking when frying eggs.
