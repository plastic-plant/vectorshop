Tried cooking pasta and it burnt on the bottom! Like, how is that even possible? The non-stick coating started peeling after a few uses, which is just not safe. Handles get hot, too. Almost burned my hand once. Clean up is a headache because food just sticks, no matter what I do. I was excited",

They say it's non-stick but everything just sticks anyway. Clean up is a nightmare. Even water doesn't come off without scrubbing hard. I feel like I wasted my money seriously... Wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Just not worth it at all. Total disappointment.",

They scratch really easy too, and I've only used them a few times. Totally a waste of money! I expected better quality for the price. Plus, they don't seem to be non-stick at all. Everything just sticks so you end up with a huge mess to clean. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Save your",

I tried to clean em and now they look even worse. saved some $$ but you get what you pay for, shoulda stuck with my old set. wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone!",
