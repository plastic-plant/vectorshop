Au d\u00e9but, l\u2019ensemble paraissait vraiment sympa, mais apr\u00e8s quelques utilisations, je me suis rendu compte de quelques d\u00e9fauts. La bonne nouvelle, c'est que elles cuisent assez bien et la chaleur se r\u00e9partit uniform\u00e9ment. Mais, apr\u00e8s quelques cuisson, il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 des rayures sur le fond, ce qui est un peu d\u00e9cevant!\n\nUne autre chose",

The pots and pans look nice and seem sturdy at first glance, but the non-stick coating isn\u2019t really living up to the hype. I\u2019ve had issues with sticking, even after careful oiling. They heat pretty evenly for the most part, but I noticed some warping after just a few uses, which is kind of a bummer.\n\nCleaning isn\u2019t super convenient either. Food",

The non-stick surface is decent, but not as great as I hoped. Sometimes things stick, especially with eggs or cheese. \n\nI love the variety of sizes included\u2014a good mix for different dishes, but the handles heat up a bit too much, which makes me worry about burning myself.

However, while cooking, I\u2019ve noticed that it doesn\u2019t heat evenly sometimes. I\u2019ve had a couple meals turn out burnt on one side while the other remains undercooked. The handles can get a bit hot too, which is a safety concern for me.\n\nClean-up is mostly fine, but you have to be careful not to scratch them if you",
