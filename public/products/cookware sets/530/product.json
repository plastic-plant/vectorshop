The non-stick coating wore off too quickly, and I found myself battling with scrambled eggs that refused to slide out of the pan. Heats unevenly, even tho I tried following the instructions. The handles are a bit flimsy and feel like they could break with any decent use. Cleaning was also a hassle since food gets stuck in weird spots. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this set, especially at this",

The non-stick coating didn\u2019t work as well as I expected; food tends to stick even when I follow the instructions. Plus, the pans feel kinda flimsy, and they heat unevenly. I've had some burnt spots while cooking, which is super frustrating. I thought the handles would have a nice grip, but they get hot really fast, so be careful. All in all,",

Al\u00e9m disso, parece que s\u00e3o muito fr\u00e1geis, algumas partes j\u00e1 come\u00e7ando a descascar depois de pouco uso.

The pans are pretty heavy which is fine, but after a couple of uses they started to scratch. Not impressed at all. I thought they'd be non-stick, but I've had food sticking to them way too easily. Clean-up is a hassle since some stuff just won\u2019t come off. Also, the handles get really hot when cooking, not safe at all. It cooks",

I found that they don't distribute heat evenly, so some things burnt while others were barely cooked. \n\nCleaning is a real pain too because food tends to stick, which is pretty frustrating.
