Some pots heat up well, while others take longer than expected. I had an issue with food sticking, even when I used oil as suggested. \n\nThe handles feel a bit cheap, and I worry about durability. It\u2019s okay for everyday cooking, but if you\u2019re looking for something to withstand heavy use, I",

Die Pfannen und T\u00f6pfe sehen super aus und sind leicht, aber ich bin etwas entt\u00e4uscht \u00fcber die Qualit\u00e4t. \n\nBeim ersten Gebrauch angebrannt, obwohl ich es richtig benutzt hab. Die Beschichtung scheint nicht so langlebig zu sein. Auch die Griffe sind nicht so stabil wie erwartet, hab ein bisschen Angst, dass sie irgendwann abbrechen.\n\nDie W\u00e4rmeverteilung",

On one hand, the design looks nice and they seem durable enough, but cooking with them hasn\u2019t been as great as I hoped. The non-stick surface isn't as effective as I expected, and I'm finding food can still stick sometimes, which makes cleaning a bit annoying. \n\nHeat distribution could also be better. Some pots heat up really well, while others feel uneven. It\u2019s a bit frustrating when you're trying to follow a",

The design is nice, and it\u2019s pretty durable, so I give it that. But the heat distribution isn't consistent; sometimes foods cook unevenly, which can be frustrating. Cleans up okay, though I\u2019ve had some food stick a little more than I expected. Overall alright for everyday cooking, but I was hoping for better quality given the price.

The non-stick surface is okay, but it's not as great as I expected and food tends to stick a bit if you don\u2019t use enough oil. The pots heat up quickly, which is nice, but I\u2019ve noticed some warping after just a few uses. \n\nThe handles are comfortable, but they're starting to come loose after a month, which is a bit concerning.
