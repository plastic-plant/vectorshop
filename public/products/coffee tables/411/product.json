I tried to put my coffee on it and the whole thing almost tipped over. The legs are flimsy, not even worth the price I paid. It was a total waste of money. Now it just takes up space in my living room. Don't buy this!",

Not sturdy at all, it wobbles when you place a drink on it. Not even easy to clean. Save your money and look for something else! I regret buying this. Would give zero stars if I could.",
