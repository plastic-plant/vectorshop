The design is pretty nice and it fits well with my living room decor, but I wasn\u2019t super impressed with the quality. The surface scratches easily, which is disappointing because I was hoping it would hold up better. Also, it's a bit wobbly on one side, so I don\u2019t feel totally secure putting drinks or heavier items on it. Setting it up was straightforward, but had some trouble with the screws not fitting",

It\u2019s a good size, and I like the storage features, which are helpful for keeping things tidy. However, I\u2019m just not sold on the quality. The materials feel a bit flimsy, and after a few days, I noticed some scratches on the surface that I wasn\u2019t expecting.

The design looks nice and fits well with my living room vibe, but the quality feels kinda cheap. There are a few scratches already that showed up after just a little bit of use, which is a bit disappointing.\n\nIt does its job for holding coffee cups and snacks, but the surface is not as sturdy as I hoped.

The design is nice and it looks good in my living room, but it just feels a bit flimsy at times, like it could easily tip over if you're not careful. I've had a couple of scratches show up already from just normal use, which is disappointing. \n\nThe pros are that it has some decent storage space underneath, and I do like the color. Perfect spot to hold magazines",
