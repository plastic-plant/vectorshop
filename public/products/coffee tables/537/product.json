The colors are cool and can match easily with my decor. However, when it comes to functionality, it\u2019s kinda lacking. It advertised a lot of tech features that just aren\u2019t super intuitive or helpful. It can be hard to connect my devices, and I've had a few glitches here and there. Plus, it feels a bit w",
