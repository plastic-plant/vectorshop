The wood finish scratches way too easily, and I've only had it for a couple of weeks. It wobbles a bit unless you have it on super level ground, which is frustrating.

The instructions were confusing, and some pieces didn't fit right. Plus, the finish started to chip after just a few weeks! \n\nIt looks nice enough if you don't get too close, but it definitely doesn't feel sturdy. I have to be careful not to put too much on it, or the legs feel",
