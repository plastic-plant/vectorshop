It looks good, and the materials seem decent enough when you first take it out of the box.\n\nHowever, I've noticed some scratches on the surface already, and I've only had it for a month. The assembly was a bit tricky too, took longer than I expected. It\u2019s not super stable; sometimes it wobbles a bit",

The design looked nice online, and it fits my living room style pretty well, but the quality isn't as great as I expected. \n\nAssembly was a bit tricky, some screws didn't fit right and I ain\u2019t too handy.

The surface scratches super easily, which for me is a bummer because I like to put my feet up sometimes. It feels a bit rickety too. I expected better quality at this price. I mean, it gets the job done for holding drinks and remote controls, but it could be sturdier. Overall, it\u2019s",

I\u2019m worried it might scratch easily, and I\u2019ve already found a small mark on it after just a few weeks. Assembly was not too bad but the parts didn\u2019t line up perfectly.
