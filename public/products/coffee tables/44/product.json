The design is nice, but it\u2019s really not very sturdy. It feels wobbly when I put my coffee down, and I've noticed scratches after just a week! The materials don't seem to be high quality either, which is a letdown for the price. I thought it would be a centerpiece for my living room, but instead, it feels more like",

It wobbles if you lean on it, which isn't cool for a living room piece. \n\nI had high hopes that it would fit well in my modern apartment, but the wood feels cheap and scratches easily. \n\nThe color is okay, but it didn't match my decor as well as I thought it would.

The assembly instructions made no sense and I ended up struggling to put it together. The surface seems to scratch pretty easily too; I already have a mark from just setting down a mug. The size is decent, but I thought it would fit my space better. Overall, it's just mediocre. I guess it",

Assembly took forever, and some pieces were missing, which was really frustrating. The surface scratches way too easily, and I already see marks on it after just a few weeks. It\u2019s also not very sturdy; I worry about putting anything heavy on it. Seats look nice but it\u2019s not practical for everyday use. Looks good in pics but not nice",
