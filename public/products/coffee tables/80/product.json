The wood seems kind of cheap and it wobbles when you put a drink on it. I\u2019m always worried it might tip over. \n\nAssembly was a headache too; the instructions weren\u2019t clear, and I had to redo a step because nothing lined up. Wish I\u2019d paid more attention to those two-star reviews. Not a total waste",

Assembly was a hassle, too; the instructions were unclear, and some screws didn\u2019t fit properly. Now, the surface scratches way easier than I thought it would.

The design is nice, I'll give it that, but it's sturdier than it looks and that's a problem. One leg was wobbly right out of the box, and even after adjusting it, it never felt secure. The finish scratches easily, too. I was hoping for something that could handle daily use, but it feels like it's going to show signs of aging way too soon. \n\nAssembly was",
