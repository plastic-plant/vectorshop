The surface scratches easily, like right outta the box. Legs don't even fit together right, it wobbles so bad! Wouldn't recommend to anyone, save your money for something better. Total waste.",

I thought it would at least be sturdy, but I have to be careful even setting down a coffee cup. The finish is already peeling after just a week! It ruined my living room vibe honestly. Can't recommend this to anyone. Major disappointment.",
