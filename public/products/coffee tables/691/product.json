Les mat\u00e9riaux semblent cheap, et les parties \u00e9taient ray\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e. Une fois mont\u00e9e, \u00e7a ne ressemble \u00e0 rien. C'est trop cher pour ce que c'est. Franchement, c'est une perte d'argent. Je ne recommande pas du tout.",

It wobbles like crazy! You can\u2019t even put a drink on it without it tipping over. Not worth the hassle. Save your cash and look for something else. I\u2019m so disappointed. Wish I could give it zero stars.",

The surface scratches so easily, and it's wobbly. I thought it was gonna be sturdy but I can\u2019t even put my coffee cup down without worrying it\u2019ll spill. Assembly was a nightmare too. Just a waste of money. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",
