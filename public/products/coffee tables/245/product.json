The design looks nice in the pictures, but in person, it\u2019s a bit smaller than expected and feels kinda light. Assembly wasn\u2019t super difficult, but some of the pieces didn\u2019t fit together perfectly, and I had to wiggle a bit to make it work. \n\nThe finish is okay; it's nice to look at but I\u2019m worried about scratches because it feels like it could get marks easily",

BUT\u2026 the assembly was a bit confusing and some of the parts didn\u2019t fit perfectly. I struggled a lot getting the legs on straight, and it took longer than I expected. \n\nKinda wobbling a little too, especially when I set my drinks on it.

The design is pretty sleek, and I love the color of the wood. \n\nIt's relatively easy to assemble, but the instructions could be clearer - I spent way too long figuring it out. The surface is a bit prone to scratches, so I\u2019ve noticed some marks after only a short time. It's sturdy enough for lightweight",

It\u2019s not super sturdy, and I worry about it holding up with regular use. Some scratches appeared after just a few weeks, so be careful. Assembly was straightforward, so that was a plus. Overall, it serves its purpose, but I expected more for the price. I\u2019d say it\u2019s decent if",
