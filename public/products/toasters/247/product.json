Toast comes out alright, but sometimes it\u2019s uneven - a bit burnt on one side and barely warm on the other. The settings are a little confusing too; I wish it was more straightforward to choose how dark I want my toast. \n\nThe build feels a bit cheap, and I don't know how long it'll last.

The settings don't seem to be very accurate, so I often have to watch it closely to make sure my toast doesn\u2019t burn. \n\nThe design is alright, kinda modern, which fits my kitchen well.

Sometimes one side comes out more golden than the other, which can be frustrating when you want a perfect slice. The settings can be a bit tricky to figure out too; some days I find the higher settings don\u2019t burn the bread while other days they turn it to charcoal. \n\nOn the plus side, it heats up",

The design is sleek and it fits nicely on my counter without taking up too much space. Toasts alright, I guess. It usually takes a couple of tries to get my bagels just right \u2013 sometimes too toasted and sometimes I can't tell if it's done.
