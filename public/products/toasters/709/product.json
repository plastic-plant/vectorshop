First off, it takes way too long to toast bread, and even then, it seems to burn it in spots. I\u2019ve tried all the settings, but nothing seems to work effectively. The crumb tray is a hassle to remove, and it doesn\u2019t catch all the crumbs anyway, so my counter ends up messy.\n\nAlso, the design is kind of cheap-looking; the shiny finish shows every smudge and",

Sometimes the outside is burnt while the inside is still cold. Plus, the settings are confusing. I\u2019ve tried different levels, but I\u2019m always either underdone or charred. It also takes forever to toast, which is just not what I expected. The size is good, though\u2014it fits nice on the counter. Overall, while it has some nice features,",

I often end up with burnt edges while the middle is still cold. Plus, it sometimes takes two rounds to get my bread golden brown. The settings seem confusing, and I wish the buttons were more intuitive. Another thing, it sounds a bit loud when in use, and that gets really annoying if I'm prepping breakfast",

Soms duurt het heel lang om mijn brood te toasten, en dan is het weer niet gelijkmatig. Een kant is vaak bruin en de andere kant bijna niet. Ook is het moeilijk om te weten welke instellingen je moet gebruiken, omdat de beschrijving niet echt helpt. Vaak moet ik het twee keer opnieuw doen voor goed resultaat.",

It claims to be some high-tech model, but all I\u2019ve gotten are undercooked slices half the time and charred ones the other. The settings are super confusing\u2014what's the point of having a dial if it doesn\u2019t even seem to work right? It just burns things! Plus, the crumb tray design is lame; it doesn\u2019t catch crumbs like it should. Also, not a fan of how it looks",
