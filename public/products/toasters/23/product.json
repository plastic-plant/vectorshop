The controls are confusing, and the settings don\u2019t really do much either. I felt like I was just guessing every time I used it. The design looks nice, but honestly, looks can\u2019t make up for poor performance. I've had it for a few months now, and it's already starting to feel like it",

I mean, I typically find myself standing there, watching bread go from raw to slightly warm without even hitting that golden-brown perfection. Sometimes it even burns the edges while leaving the middle cold. \n\nAlso, the controls are a little confusing. The timer dials don\u2019t really match the toast color at all. I had to",

The toast it makes isn\u2019t even that crispy, and half the time it burns the edges. The different settings seem to not do much at all, and it's really inconsistent. Plus, it takes a long time to pop up the bread! \n\nIt looks nice on the counter but with all the problems, I kind of regret the purchase. Not sure if I want to keep",

It takes longer than expected and I usually end up having to toast my bread again because it doesn\u2019t brown evenly. I\u2019ve tried different settings, and they don\u2019t seem to make much difference.  Also, the design looked nice at first, but it\u2019s hard to clean! Crumbs get stuck in hard to reach areas.",

Sometimes my bread comes out burnt on one side and barely golden on the other. Really frustrating when you're in a hurry. The dials are a bit confusing too. I think I adjust them correctly, but results are still hit or miss. Plus, it takes longer than it should to pop up. I expected better for the price. I'm gonna keep using it for now, but",
