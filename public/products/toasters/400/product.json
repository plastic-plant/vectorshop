The buttons stick and I have to press them multiple times to make it work. Also super slow. Takes forever just to toast. I just don\u2019t get it. Maybe I got a faulty one, but honestly, I think it's just junk. Save your cash and get something else!",

            "review": "This toaster is completely useless. Burns everything I put in it no matter what setting I use. It's like it's possessed or something. I tried bread, bagels, even frozen waffles, and they're all just charred scraps when I pull them out. Plus, it takes forever to even start toasting. I've owned cheap ones before and they worked way better than this junk. Don't waste your money, trust me. I\u2019m going back to my old one that did the job right. 1 star",

So frustrated. The crumb tray doesn\u2019t even fit right and just falls out. Totally not worth the money. Don\u2019t waste your time or dough on this!",
