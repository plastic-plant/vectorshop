The design is pretty sleek and fits my kitchen nicely, but it has its quirks. \n\nFirst off, it does toast bread well, but sometimes it takes longer than expected. I\u2019ve noticed that I have to give it a few tries to get the desired darkness on the bread, which is kind of annoying. The settings are a bit confusing too; it feels like some of them don't really do much",

The browning settings aren\u2019t super consistent, so sometimes I end up with a slice that\u2019s perfectly golden on one side and totally pale on the other. \n\nIt\u2019s also a bit bulky; takes up more space on my counter than I\u2019d like. The design looks nice, but it would be better with a retractable cord. For the price,",
