Sometimes the toast comes out great, but other times it\u2019s either too burnt or barely warmed up. The knobs and settings can be a bit confusing, you know? Took me a few tries to figure out the best combo. \n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t fit all types of bread well, which is a pain if you have thick slices. Cleaning is a hassle too",

Sometimes the toast comes out perfectly, but other times it burns even on the lowest setting. The uneven toasting is a real letdown. \n\nThe features are a bit gimmicky too. The bagel setting does improve things, but it doesn't seem to make much difference for regular bread. And the crumb tray",

It does toast bread, which is nice, but it takes longer than my old one. Sometimes I have to keep hitting the lever because it pops up too early. The extra settings for different types of bread are a nice touch, but honestly, they don\u2019t seem to really make much of a difference.\n\nIt looks sleek and modern on my counter, and the different colors",

            "review": "Honestly, it\u2019s kinda a mixed bag. The design is sleek and looks great on my counter, but it doesn\u2019t always toast evenly. Sometimes I get one side a little burnt while the other is barely done. It's a real bummer when you have to keep flipping the bread and checking on it. The settings feel a bit off too; like, I might expect a darker toast on 4, but it\u2019s more of a light golden. Plus, it doesn't toast bagels very well \u2014",
