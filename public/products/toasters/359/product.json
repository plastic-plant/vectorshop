I\u2019ve tried every setting and it still doesn\u2019t work right. Bread gets stuck, and it\u2019s not even easy to clean. The whole thing feels cheap and flimsy. I just don\u2019t get all the hype! Save your cash and buy a different one. So disappointed! Never again!",

The design isn\u2019t great, crumbs everywhere, and it doesn\u2019t even pop up properly! So frustrating. I expected way more for the price. Totally regret buying this. Wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Save your money!",

            "review": "This toaster is a joke. It barely toasts the bread, if you can even call it that. Half the time it doesn\u2019t even pop up the toast. I have to keep checking on it, then when it does finally pop it\u2019s either burnt to a crisp or still cold. The settings make no sense. I wasted so much bread trying to figure it out. And it looks kinda cheap too, like something from a garage sale. Honestly, I wish I could return it, but it",
