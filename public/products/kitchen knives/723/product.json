Depois de umas semanas, tava at\u00e9 meio oxidada. A pega tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 confort\u00e1vel, escorrega f\u00e1cil. Senti que joguei dinheiro fora. N\u00e3o recomendo!",

            "review": "I really regret buying this knife. It doesn't cut well at all, feels cheap and flimsy. I tried chopping some veggies and it wouldn\u2019t go through. Blade dulled after a few uses. I ended up grabbing my old knife instead. Plus, the handle is uncomfortable, slips when wet. I don\u2019t get the hype. Just a total waste of money. Disappointing. Save your cash and get something else.",
