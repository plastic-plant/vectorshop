The handle feels cheap and kinda slippery, makes it hard to get a good grip. It looks nice on the counter, but it just doesn\u2019t perform like it should. Not worth the money in my opinion.

At first glance, it looks cool and all, but when I tried to chop some veggies, I found it pretty dull out of the box. Had to press way too hard and after a few slices, it just kinda struggles. \n\nThe grip isn\u2019t the best either, feels cheap and a bit slippery when hands are wet.

Ik had gehoopt op precisie, maar het moeilijk om zelfs door zachte groenten te snijden. Het heft voelt ook niet fijn aan; het glijdt soms uit je hand tijdens gebruik. Voor deze prijs had ik gewoon wat meer verwacht. Duo dan tegengevallen, echt jammer!\u2702\ufe0f",
