            "review": "I bought these knives hoping for quality but got super disappointed. They feel cheap and way too light. The edge dulls sooo fast, and I've barely used them. Had to sharpen them after only a few veggies! The handles are really uncomfortable too, just don't feel right when I'm using them. Think I'm gonna return them. Not worth the money at all, honestly. Save your cash and go for something else! Total waste. \ud83e\udd74",

            "review": "Got this knife set and I'm really disappointed. Cutting veggies feels like I'm using a dull butter knife. Just can\u2019t get a clean slice, it\u2019s like they\u2019re all rounded off or something. The handles are uncomfortable too, super slippery and hard to grip. Tried to chop some meat and it was just useless. I don't know what everyone else sees in these things, but I regret my purchase big time. Save your money, don\u2019t buy. Feels like a complete waste.",
