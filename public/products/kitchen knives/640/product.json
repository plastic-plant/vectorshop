The blades are sharp enough but not consistent, some slices through like a dream while others feel dull. The handles also aren\u2019t very comfortable; they\u2019re slippery when wet, which is pretty annoying when cooking. The design looks nice but feels cheap. I can find better quality knives for less. Overall, not what I expected and I wouldn\u2019t recommend them if you're cooking regularly, just can't trust them",

            "review": "I've had high hopes for these knives given the hype, but I'm pretty disappointed. They look nice on the counter, but the blades don't stay sharp for long at all. I expected to slice through veggies and meats with ease, yet I find myself struggling more often than not. The handle is kinda uncomfortable too, not the best grip. I've had to pull out my old set a few times now because these just weren't cutting it\u2026 literally. Can't say I'd recommend based on my experience.",
