I thought maybe it just needed to be used more but nope, still terrible after weeks. Had a much cheaper knife that worked better. Plus, it\u2019s super uncomfortable to hold, kind of slips in your hand. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone. Save your money!",

Handles are cheap and uncomfortable too, slips all the time. I've almost cut myself a few times. Really regret wasting my money on this. Don't bother with it at all.",

The grip is super uncomfortable, slips right outta my hand when I try to chop. Is the blade even sharp? It's so dull I could probably use a butter knife and get better results. After a few uses, there were stains that won\u2019t come off. Seriously, I can't believe I wasted my money on this.  Definitely going in the",
