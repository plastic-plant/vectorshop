I had to saw my way through, what a joke! Plus, the handle is slippery and uncomfortable to hold. I tried sharpening it too, but no luck. It doesn't stay sharp at all. Wish I could get my money back, totally regret this purchase. 1 star is too generous.",

            "review": "This knife is a total joke. Tried to slice a tomato and it just squished it instead of cutting! The handle feels cheap and uncomfortable. I had higher hopes and ended up with a sore hand. After one wash, there are scratches all over it. Where\u2019s the quality, huh? Definitely would not recommend to anyone. Save your money. The knife is just not worth it.",

            "review": "awful knife. right out of the box it felt cheap and flimsy. tried to slice some veggies and it couldn't even cut thru a tomato!! edge was dull as my old rusty knives. it slips in your hand really easy too so gotta be careful not to cut yourself. seves some weird purpose but its def not for any heavy duty needs. I regret buying this and thought it would be better based on so-called reviews. do yourself a favor and skip this one.",

Tried to use it for slicing veggies and it just squished them instead. I've bought budget knives before that work better than this. Can't even get a nice sharpness, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t care about quality at all. Total waste of money, honestly. I wish I'd read the other reviews before buying, cause this one is definitely not worth it",
