I\u2019ve noticed it gets dull quicker than I hoped, especially after cutting tomatoes and onions. The handle feels nice and is comfortable to hold, which is a plus. It just doesn\u2019t seem to live up to the \u2018professional\u2019 hype. \n\nI do like the design, it looks sharp sitting in my kitchen. But when it comes",

The design looks nice and it feels pretty comfortable to hold, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations in the kitchen. It cuts well enough, but I\u2019ve had to sharpen it more often than I thought I would. Also, it's a little heavy for my liking, which made it a bit tougher during longer prep sessions.\n\nIt looks good, and for the price, I guess you can\u2019t be too",
