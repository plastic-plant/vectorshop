Sie schneiden nicht richtig und sind mega schnell stumpf. nach paar Mal benutzen muss ich sie schon sch\u00e4rfen, was ein Scherz ist. Der Griff ist unbequem und rutscht die ganze Zeit. Hab mehr erwartet f\u00fcr den Preis. W\u00fcrde ich nie nochmal kaufen und kann sie echt nicht empfehlen. Nicht mal als Ersatz. Echt entt\u00e4uschend.",

I tried chopping veggies and ended up squishing them instead. Such a waste of money! Also, they got dull super fast. I thought I was buying something decent but they feel cheap and flimsy. Worst kitchen knives ever! Save your time and cash and go for something more reliable.",

They don\u2019t slice through anything, I ending up tearing my veggies instead of chopping them. The quality is cheap, and the grip feels slippery. Tried to use them on meat and it was a no-go. After a week they already look dull. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone. Save your money!",

Yeah, not even sharp! I ended up using more force than I wanted and nearly sliced my hand. Also, the handle feels weird and cheap. It slips when your hands are wet, which is dangerous. \n\nAfter washing, the blades look all scratched and they rusted too! What\u2019s the point of having knives that you can",
