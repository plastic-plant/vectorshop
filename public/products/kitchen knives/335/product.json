O corte \u00e9 bom na maioria das vezes, mas j\u00e1 encontrei algumas falhas. \u00c0s vezes, ela N\u00e3o parece t\u00e3o afiada como esperava, principalmente em carnes mais duras. A sensa\u00e7\u00e3o na m\u00e3o \u00e9 confort\u00e1vel e a qualidade do material parece decentemente boa, mas o pre\u00e7o deixou a desejar. Achei que trabalhando melhor para o que paguei. No geral, \u00e9 uma faca ok, mas n\u00e3o atende totalmente minhas expectativas",

After a few uses, I found myself having to sharpen it more often than I'd like, which is a bit annoying. \n\nIt's fine for basic chopping but if you're doing a lot of prep work, it might not stay sharp long enough. The design looks good on my countertop, but I'm unsure",

Cuts pretty well through meats and veggies, but sometimes it just doesn\u2019t slice as smoothly as I expected. Kind of odd for the price point.\n\nAlso, the handle is comfortable, but it gets a bit slippery when my hands are wet. I really liked how sharp it was out of the box, but after a few weeks, it doesn\u2019t hold the edge as well as I hoped.",

The design is nice, and they look sharp (pun intended), but they don't hold an edge well at all. I found myself having to sharpen them pretty frequently, which is frustrating. \n\nThe handle is comfortable enough, but I expected a bit more ergonomic design for the price. The performance is decent for casual slicing, but if you're into serious meal prep, you might want to look elsewhere.",

The blade is sharp enough for slicing, but it doesn\u2019t hold its edge as long as I would like. The handle feels a bit flimsy, and I\u2019m worried it could break if I apply too much pressure. \n\nIt cuts well through most veggies and meats, but I found some things, like tough skins, can be a challenge. Cleaning it is simple, but",
