It doesn't keep me warm, and I found myself adjusting it all the time. The colors are vibrant, but they don't match with a lot in my wardrobe. It's a nice idea, but overall, just kinda disappointed. Could've been way better.",

            "review": "I had high hopes for these scarves, but honestly, they didn't impress me at all. The fabric feels kind of cheap and not warm enough for colder days. Also, they don't stay in place, keep slipping off my shoulders. I expected them to be versatile, but they just don\u2019t look good with most outfits. Plus, they\u2019re hard to wash, like they lose shape. They\u2019re not terrible, but definitely not worth the hype. Two stars cause they look okay if you can manage to",

I've tried styling them in different ways, but they just seem to fall flat and don't stay in place. The colors are okay, but not as vibrant as I expected. I appreciate the idea, but the execution just isn\u2019t there. Overall, a bit disappointed since I had higher expectations.",
