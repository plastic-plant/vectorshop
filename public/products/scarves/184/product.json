It\u2019s scratchy and doesn\u2019t wrap well at all. I tried to wear it out, but it just wouldn\u2019t stay in place. Totally a waste of my money. I can\u2019t believe others liked it.",

Tried to wear it out, but it kept slipping off my shoulders. So annoying! Also, it looks NOTHING like the pictures online. I honestly don\u2019t get the hype. Save your cash and look elsewhere, there\u2019s way better stuff out there. Would give this a zero if I could.",

            "review": "I was super excited about these scarves but they were a big letdown. The fabric feels cheap and scratchy, way worse than I expected. They just don't sit right on my neck, kinda stiff. And the colors aren't as bright as in the pics, like totally faded or something. I was really hoping to wear them out but no way! Save your money, don't recommend at all. Total waste.",

Plus, the color I got looked different from the pics. It doesn't keep me warm at all! Honestly, I just wear it for looks but it's not even pretty after a few washes. Totally regret spending my money on it. Would not recommend, so disappointed.",
