The patterns are nice to look at \u2013 I\u2019ll give them that \u2013 but the material feels a bit on the rough side, not as soft as I expected. I thought they\u2019d be cozy for winter, but they scratch a little. They don\u2019t keep me super warm, either. For the price, I thought I\u2019d get something more high-quality.

Me gusta el dise\u00f1o y hay varios colores bonitos, pero la tela se siente un poco m\u00e1s delgada de lo que esperaba. Al principio pens\u00e9 que ser\u00eda muy suave, pero siento que me pica un poco en el cuello a veces. Adem\u00e1s, no abriga mucho en d\u00edas fr\u00edos, as\u00ed que no lo usar\u00e9 tanto como pens\u00e9. Es un buen complemento para crear estilo, pero no le dar\u00eda m\u00e1s de 3 estrellas.",

I was hoping for more warmth and sturdiness given the price. The colors look great, but after a few washes, I noticed a bit of fading.\n\nWhen I wear them, they fit well and don't slip off too much, which is a plus.

The designs are really pretty, and they do feel nice against the skin. But I\u2019ve noticed that the material seems a bit thinner than I expected, so I worry about snagging or them not holding up after a wash. \n\nThey do keep me warm enough, but I wouldn\u2019t call it super cozy, especially on chilly nights.
