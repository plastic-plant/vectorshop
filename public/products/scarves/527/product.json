The colors looked nice in pics but in person they\u2019re just... off? Kinda dull. It also started to fray after only a few uses. Not worth the money at all. Save your cash and find something better! Total disappointment",

The colors looked great online, but in person they are totally off and kinda dull. It\u2019s also way too thin; I almost don't feel anything when I wear it. I tried to return it but the process was a hassle. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your money.",

            "review": "I was really excited to get this scarf but what a letdown! The material feels cheap and scratchy, not soft like I hoped. It also came with a weird smell that just wouldn't go away no matter how many times I washed it. The colors are kind of dull, definitely not what I expected from the pics. Trying to use it as an actual scarf made me feel like I was wearing a bunch of fabric knots. Not worth the money at all. Save your cash and find something better",

After a month, it started to fray at the edges. I can\u2019t even wear it anymore. Waste of money! Seriously, don\u2019t bother.",

Plus, the colors are way off; I got this bright red and it looks more like a dull pink. Also, it\u2019s way too thin. Didn\u2019t keep me warm at all. I ended up returning it. So disappointed, wouldn\u2019t recommend. Save your money.",
