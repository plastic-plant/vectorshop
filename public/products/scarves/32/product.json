Sometimes, it feels like I\u2019m wearing just a light fabric rather than something that really wraps around well. The colors are nice and vibrant, which is a plus, but I wish they had more patterns to choose from. \n\nWhen I try to style them in different ways, they don\u2019t hold up as nicely as I hoped.

It\u2019s fine for layering, but on really cold days, I found myself wishing for something cozier. \n\nThe variety of colors is nice, but some hues seemed a bit different from what\u2019s shown online.

I really wanted something warm and cozy for winter, but I don't think it\u2019ll do the trick. The colors are pretty cool, though, so that's a plus. \n\nThey look stylish and all, and I did enjoy wearing it for a night out, but I found myself needing a sweater underneath.

The styles are cute, and I appreciate the variety, but when it gets really cold, I feel like I could use a bit thicker material. It's perfect for layering, but that\u2019s about it.
