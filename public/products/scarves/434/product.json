The material feels kind of cheap, not soft like I expected, and it doesn\u2019t wrap around nicely. The colors are pretty, but they didn\u2019t look as good in person. I\u2019ve worn it a few times, but it slides off easily and isn\u2019t very warm at all. I'm just not impressed. For the price, I thought I\u2019d get better quality. Just feel kinda let down",

It's fine if you're just looking for something light, but for the price, I expected a bit more. I guess I should've read the reviews",
