I expected it to be a bit more fashionable and versatile for different outfits, but it doesn't really pop. The colors are nice but not exactly what I was looking for\u2014more muted than vibrant. It tends to snag a bit, too, which is kind of annoying. Overall, it\u2019s warm and does the job, just nothing super",

I thought it would keep me warmer, but it doesn\u2019t really block the wind too well. The color I got is pretty, definitely a nice shade, but the stitching had some loose threads.
