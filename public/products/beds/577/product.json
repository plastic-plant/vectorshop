Tried to give it a chance but I just can't. The memory foam is a joke, and it smells weird too. If you want a good night\u2019s sleep, stay far away from this one. Definitely regretting this purchase.",

Never thought a mattress could be this bad. Plus, it smells weird and takes forever to air out. The edges sunk in right away too, feels cheap. I guess you get what you pay for but seriously, I\u2019d rather sleep on the floor. Total waste of money. Would NOT recommend to anyone.",
