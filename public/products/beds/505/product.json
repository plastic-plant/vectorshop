I can\u2019t sleep all night without waking up sore. The setup was a nightmare, too. Instructions were confusing. Also, it creaks like crazy, I can\u2019t believe it! I mean who thought this was a good idea? I\u2019d rather sleep on the floor. Honestly, save your money and look for something better.",

The adjustable features are a joke too. I thought I could find my perfect position, but it just feels weird. \n\nAnd don't get me started on the noise. Every time I try to move, it creaks like it's gonna fall apart! Plus, the setup was a nightmare. Took forever, instructions",

The \u201cserenity\u201d idea is a joke. The mattress gives no support at all, and I'm constantly adjusting myself just to find some comfort. The setup was a nightmare too, lots of parts, and just a total hassle. I thought I\u2019d get more for what I paid, but this is honestly the",
