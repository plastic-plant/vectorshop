The design is nice and I love the way it looks in my bedroom, but comfort-wise, it\u2019s just okay. Some nights I sleep like a baby, while other nights I end up tossing and turning. The mattress is a bit firmer than I expected, which isn\u2019t a dealbreaker, but I was hoping for a softer feel. \n\nThe support is decent, but I thought the hype",

The memory foam does contour well, but it also feels hot sometimes, which means I wake up sweating. \n\nSetup was easy, and it looks nice\u2014definitely a plus for my bedroom. However, I ended up noticing some creaking when I change positions, which is kind of annoying, especially at night",

Man sinkt zwar gut ein, jedoch f\u00fchlte ich mich manchmal nicht wirklich unterst\u00fctzt. \n\nDie Matratze ist relativ weich \u2013 gut f\u00fcr die, die es m\u00f6gen, aber nicht ganz mein Fall. Auch der Stoff des Bezugs sieht sch\u00f6n aus, f\u00fchlt sich aber schneller abgenutzt an, als ich dachte. Die Verarbeitung wirkt insgesamt solide, aber ich habe schon bessere",
