It took forever to get it all together. Once I finally got it set up, I found the mattress way too firm for my liking. It wasn\u2019t comfortable at all and I woke up with back pain more than once. Also, the fabric feels cheap. I expected way more for the price. Very disappointed overall.",

It\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t support me properly. The design is nice, but that doesn\u2019t help much when I can\u2019t sleep well. I've tried adjusting it every night, but nothing changes. The app was confusing to set up too\u2014why does it need so much input? I wish I could say I loved it",

The comfort level is kind of a mixed bag. Some nights I wake up feeling sore and restless, which is not what I expected.
