The mattress feels so cheap and I wake up feeling sore every morning. The frame is creaky and every little movement makes noise. It doesn\u2019t stay together either, it feels wobbly. Customer service was no help when I reached out. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it at all. Save your money and get something else. Total letdown!",

The mattress doesn't hold its shape at all, sagging in places after just a week. It\u2019s noisy too! Every time I move, it squeaks and creaks like it\u2019s falling apart. I expected better quality for the price! Save your money and buy something else. I regret this purchase so much",

I was excited but its super uncomfortable, feels like im sleeping on a board. had it for a month and now it sinks in the middle so bad. the setup was also a pain - like who designed this? the mattress odor was awful too, took days to air out. sleep quality didn't improve at all, actually i wake up feeling worse. trust me, do not waste your money on this one. only 1 star because there's no option for zero.",

Every time I move, it creaks loud enough to wake the whole house. Not worth the money at all. Should've stuck with my old one. Really regretting this purchase. Do yourself a favor and avoid!",

Assembly was a pain too, instructions were super unclear. Not worth the money at all. Wish I could return it but I\u2019m stuck! Save your cash and look elsewhere. So disappointed!",
