I like that they\u2019re made from sustainable materials, but the grip isn\u2019t as good as I expected. Just a few times, I noticed they slide around on my floor, which can be pretty annoying. Also, they don\u2019t seem to cushion my feet as much as I would\u2019ve hoped. Overall, they're decent for the price, but I think",

Also, some stains don\u2019t come out as easily as I'd like. They sort of look nice, but I feel like I could have found something better for the price. Overall, they",

They feel a bit thin underfoot, and I was hoping for plush comfort. They are non-slip, which is a plus, but they also seem to collect dirt more easily than I'd like. Cleaning them isn't too hard, but they're not super durable, so I worry about how they'll hold up. Overall, they do the job but",
