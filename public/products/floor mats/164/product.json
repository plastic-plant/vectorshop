            "review": "This mat is awful. I expected something good but it just doesn't stay in place. Every time I walk on it, it slips all over the floor. The texture feels weird too, not soft at all like I thought. After a week, it started to tear little bits just from normal use. It doesn't really clean well either, stains just stick. Seriously regret buying this, total waste of money! 1 star is too generous.",

I thought it would be durable but after a week, it looked worn out already. The colors are blah too, nothing like the pictures. So not worth the money. In the end, I'm just annoyed \ud83e\udd2c. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone!",
