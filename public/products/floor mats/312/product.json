It feels softer than some, but I was hoping for something a bit more cushy, and this just doesn't cut it. \n\nI've had it for a few weeks now and I've noticed it slips around way too much on my tile floors. I almost fell a couple of times! It can get really rough when the vacuum",

It moves around a lot on the floor, making it kinda annoying to keep in place. Plus, it\u2019s not very good at catching dirt or moisture like I hoped. Honestly, I thought it would be more eco-friendly, but it just seems like another regular mat. I wish it lived up to the hype because",

It doesn\u2019t stay in place very well, and I keep tripping over the edges. The material looks nice, but it feels cheap. Cleaning is a hassle too, stains just don\u2019t come out easily. I expected better for the price. It does its job but not really impressed over all. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something durable.",

It's supposed to be eco-friendly, which I appreciate, but I didn\u2019t expect it to come with such poor texture. The grip isn't that great either; it slides a lot on the floor, even though it claims to be non-slip. I've already tripped twice, which is a major hassle. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll last long with regular use",
