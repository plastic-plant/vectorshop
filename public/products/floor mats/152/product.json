A veces se mueve y eso es un poco molesto. La textura es agradable, pero mi perro la ha ara\u00f1ado un poco. Por el precio me esperaba algo m\u00e1s resistente. En general, es bueno, pero no s\u00e9 si vale la pena.",

However, it just doesn\u2019t stay in place very well. I find myself constantly adjusting it since it tends to slide around on the floor, which can be a bit annoying. \n\nIt\u2019s decent for cushioning when I\u2019m standing, but I expected a bit more comfort for the price I paid. The material does seem quite durable",

            "review": "I recently picked up this eco-friendly floor mat, expecting some great functionality given the price point. While I appreciate the sustainable materials, it didn't live up to all the hype. First off, the size could be better; I was hoping it would cover more area. It does feel decent underfoot, but it's not as cushy as I imagined. \n\nCleaning it is kind of a hassle\u2014it tends to trap dirt, and I have to scrub it quite a bit. The color selection is okay,",

It looks nice at first glance, but it slides around way too easily on my hardwood floors, which is really frustrating. I thought it would help keep things cozy in the living room, but it just keeps bunching up. \n\nThe material feels okay, but I expected it to be more cushy, especially for the price. It doesn\u2019t seem to grip well or provide the comfort I hoped for",
