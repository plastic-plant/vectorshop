The color and design looked great online, but in person, it felt kinda cheap. After a few weeks, it started to show wear and tear already, like the edges were fraying. Also, it slips way too easily on my hardwood floor, so I\u2019ve had a few near falls. I thought it would be easier to clean too, but dust and dirt seem to cling to it",

It looks nice in the pictures, but in person it doesn\u2019t really match up. I've spilled a couple things on it and cleaning is tougher than I thought it would be. It doesn\u2019t really grip the floor well either, keeps sliding around which is annoying when you're walking on it. Not a total waste, but I probably won\u2019t buy",

            "review": "Ik moet zeggen, ik verwachtte meer van deze vloermat. Het lijkt mooi en eco-vriendelijk, maar na een paar weken beginnen de randen al te slijt\u034fen. Niet zo comfortabel voor mijn voeten als ik had gehoopt. Ook krijg je een vreemde geur die niet weggaat. Veel geld voor iets dat niet lang meegaat! Klonk echt leuk, maar helaas is het teleurstellend. Zeker niet de kwaliteit die ik zocht.",
