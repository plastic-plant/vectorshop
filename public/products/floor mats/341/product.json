It's super thin too, doesn\u2019t feel comfy at all. I've had it for a few weeks and already see wear and tear, not worth the price. I thought it would be eco-friendly or something, but it just feels cheap. Seriously don\u2019t waste your money.",

It slips all over the place on my floor, really unsafe. I expected something good for the price but it feels cheap, like it's kinda falling apart already. \n\nNot easy to clean either, it just collects dust and I have to bleach it to make it look okay. Can't even use it as a decoration because it looks like it came from a bargain",

            "review": "I really regret buying this mat. It just doesn't grip the floor at all. It slides around like it's trying to escape. Plus, it's super thin, feels cheap under my feet. One edge keeps curling up, and that's a tripping hazard. Not to mention the colors looked way nicer online, but in person? So dull and lifeless. I expected better but honestly, I'm just disappointed. Save your money and look elsewhere.",
