They look nice enough when they're laid out, and the colors go pretty well with my decor, but I'm not in love with them. \n\nOn the one hand, they do offer decent cushioning, making it more comfortable to stand on for longer periods. However, I've also noticed they're a bit slippery on my hardwood floors, which makes me a little nervous sometimes. I've almost slipped a couple of times.",

Sure, they\u2019re pretty and seemed durable at first, but they don't hold up as well as I\u2019d hoped. After a few weeks of regular use, they started to slip around more than I would like, and keeping them clean is a hassle. They show dirt surprisingly quickly. It\u2019s not the worst product I\u2019ve ever bought, but I feel like I could",

The design is pretty nice, but they slip around more than I expected, which is kind of annoying. I thought they would be a little more cushioned underfoot, too. They do catch some dirt and mud well, I\u2019ll give them that, but just not as grippy as they say. It\u2019s like they could have tried a bit harder with the grip. Overall, not",

However, they feel a bit thinner than I expected. After a couple of weeks, I noticed some wear and tear already, which is kinda disappointing. They do stay in place quite well which is a plus, but I just feel like for the price, they should be more durable. Not bad if you prefer looks over longevity, but wouldn",
