I thought it would be durable, but it started to fray after a few days. The colors are nice but that\u2019s about it. Not worth the money I spent. Super disappointed. Can\u2019t recommend it.",

The material feels so cheap and flimsy, like it's gonna rip any second. Plus it slips around everywhere, not grippy at all! I almost fell a couple times. I thought it would be nice to have something good for the planet, but this isn\u2019t it. I regret buying it, I should have read the reviews first. Seriously cannot recommend.",

Also, it stains way too easily\u2014 spilled a little water and now it\u2019s got ugly spots. Cleaning it is a pain too, some dirt gets stuck and I can\u2019t get it out. Just wish I hadn\u2019t wasted my money on this. Definitely not worth it!!",

The material feels cheap and it's super thin, not comfy at all. It slips around everywhere, my kids almost fell a couple of times. Tried to clean it, but stains just won\u2019t come off. Waste of money, honestly. Not worth the hype. 1 star for sure.",
