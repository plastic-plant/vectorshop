It felt more like poking my gums than cleaning my teeth. The battery life seems okay, but it takes forever to charge.

While it has some cool features that caught my eye, the performance is pretty underwhelming. The bristles are too soft, and I feel like I\u2019m just pushing the dirt around my teeth instead of actually cleaning them. The smart technology just isn\u2019t intuitive; I spent more time trying to figure out which settings to use than actually brushing. The battery life is mediocre too. I mean,",
