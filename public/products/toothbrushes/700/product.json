It barely vibrates and doesn\u2019t reach the back of my mouth. Battery life is terrible, I have to charge it all the time! Disappointed and it's just not worth the money. Would not recommend. Definitely won't be using it anymore. Save your cash!",

The battery life is terrible, had to charge it after a week and it didn\u2019t even last that long. The design is... well, weird with weird buttons. Can\u2019t even tell when it\u2019s on half the time. I ended up going back to my old one, way better. Save your",

The battery died super fast, had to recharge it all the time. Also, the brush head is too big and makes it hard to get to the back teeth. Honestly, I thought it would be great but it just doesn\u2019t work for me. Save your money and look for something else.",

Plus wasn\u2019t even any good at kinda getting to those hard spots. It feels cheap and the app barely works. I just wanted to get my teeth nice and clean, but this was just a waste of money. Save your cash and get one from the store instead. Total letdown!!",
