The bristles are soft, which is nice for sensitive gums, but I feel like it doesn\u2019t get my teeth as clean as I hoped. The design is okay, but it feels a bit bulky in my hand. The battery life is decent, but I've had to charge it sooner than expected. It\u2019s not bad, but not the best I\u2019ve tried. On yeah, it's also somewhat noisy",

The battery life is decent too. However, I expected a bit more from the cleaning power. My teeth don\u2019t feel as polished compared to my old one. \n\nThe smart features are cool, but sometimes they feel gimmicky. I find myself not using them often. It makes good claims, but",
