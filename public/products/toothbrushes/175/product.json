The vibrations are strong and it gets my teeth pretty clean. But honestly, it feels a bit bulky in my hand, which makes it awkward to use sometimes. The battery life is decent, but I expected a bit more for the price.\n\nI\u2019ve had better results with simpler brushes, and I don't find the extra settings that useful. Sometimes I think less",

It has some nice features like the timer and the multiple settings, but honestly, it feels a bit bulky in my hand. The bristles are softer than I expected, which might be good for some, but I prefer a firmer brush. It does a decent job of cleaning, but it hasn\u2019t wowed me like I hoped it would. I've had better brushes in the past. The battery life",

The features are decent, like the different modes, but they don\u2019t feel that different to me. The battery life is average, and the brush head is a little too hard for my gums, so I feel like I have to be careful not to press too hard. Cleaning seems fine, but I\u2019ve had electric brushes before that just felt better. Overall, it\u2019s better",
