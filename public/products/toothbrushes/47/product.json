The vibrations are fine, and it cleans okay, but I expected more for the price. The battery life is okay, but it dies faster than I\u2019d like. The design is nice, sleek and all, but it slips a bit when wet. I mean, it\u2019s doing its job, my teeth feel clean, but it doesn\u2019t feel as special as",

The vibrations and settings are nice, but I find it a bit bulky to handle comfortably. The battery life seems decent, but charging takes longer than I thought it would. I feel like it cleans well but not 3 times better than my old one. Overall, it\u2019s okay for the price, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a must-have.",

The design is nice, and the colors are pretty, but the brushing Action isn't as powerful as I hoped. Sometimes I feel like I have to go over the same spot multiple times to feel clean. The timer feature is helpful, but I sometimes forget to start it, so it's kinda useless for me. Battery life is okay, but I've had to charge it more often than",

The design is sleek and it feels good in my hand, but I don't think it's doing anything special for my teeth. There are times when I feel like it doesn't remove all the plaque as well as my old manual brush did. The battery life is decent, but I've had to recharge more often than I expected. The different modes are neat, but I usually stick to one because the others seem pointless. Overall",

The features are neat, like the different settings and reminders, but I don't think it really did anything special for my teeth. It felt kind of awkward to use, and after a week, I didn't see much improvement in my oral hygiene. The app was a bit glitchy, too, which was frustrating. I appreciate the innovation, but it didn\u2019t quite live up to my expectations. It\u2019s decent if you want something",
