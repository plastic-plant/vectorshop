The rotating feature is kinda neat, but honestly, it didn\u2019t feel like it cleaned my teeth better than my old one. The battery life is decent, lasts a couple of weeks, but I had some trouble with it charging. Not a huge fan of the design either; I prefer something simpler that fits better in my hand. The app connectivity is a nice touch, I",

The 360-degree brushing is neat, but honestly, I don\u2019t feel any huge difference compared to my old one. Sometimes it even seems like it misses spots! The design is cool, and I like the colors but the battery life could be better. Pretty much having to charge it way too often for my liking. If you",

The design is sleek, and I really like the idea of 360-degree cleaning, but I feel like it doesn\u2019t always get my teeth as clean as my old toothbrush. The bristles are a bit too soft for my liking\u2014I prefer something with a firmer touch.

It's got some neat features like the rotating bristles and a timer, but I feel like it doesn't really clean my teeth better than my old manual toothbrush.

But to be honest, I expected a bit more from it given the hype. Sometimes it feels like it doesn't clean as well as my old manual brush. Also, the battery life is decent but not great.
