I was expecting something super cozy, but these don't have much padding. The fit is weird too; they\u2019re either too tight or too loose. Also, they didn\u2019t stay on my feet properly, which is super annoying when just walking around the house. The design is nice, but that\u2019s not enough when the comfort isn't there. I was hoping for more",

Het uiterlijk is leuk, maar dat helpt niet als ze zo snel kapot gaan. De hele dag heb ik pijn in mijn voeten omdat ze echt niet goed passen. Ze zijn ook niet zo warm als ik gehoopt had. Jammer, want ik dacht dat ze perfect zouden zijn voor de winter. Zou ze niet aanraden.",

They feel nice at first, but after wearing them for a bit, they start to lose their shape and support. Plus, they're kinda slippery on the floor, which is a little scary when you're walking around the house. \n\nI noticed some threads coming loose after only a week, which is not what I expected. They also don\u2019t keep my feet very warm like I thought they would. Thought I was getting",

The design seems cute, and they do feel soft at first, but the comfort doesn\u2019t last long. After wearing them for a little bit, the cushioning flattened out and they felt kind of cold. Also, they slip off my heels easily, which is super annoying when I walk around. The sizing feels a bit off too. I got my usual size, but they\u2019re larger than I expected. Honestly, I",

They feel a bit flimsy and don\u2019t really give the support I expected. Also, after a few uses, the fabric started to look a bit worn out, which is disappointing. The sizing feels off too \u2013 they\u2019re either too tight or too loose. I don't know. Maybe they just don't work for me. Could be better!",
