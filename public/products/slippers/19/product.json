On one hand, they're really soft and cozy when you first put them on. The cloud-like cushion is nice, and it feels like walking on a little pillow. \n\nBut after wearing them for a while, I noticed they don\u2019t have the best grip on the bottom. I slipped a few times on my hardwood floors, which was a bit annoying. Also, they don\u2019t",

The cushioning is nice at first, but it doesn\u2019t hold up after a few hours. They also run a bit small, which was kinda a letdown because I went up a size as suggested. The style is cute, but the material feels kinda cheap. I really wanted to love them since everyone was raving about them, but they don't quite live",

The material is soft, but they tend to get a bit warm after wearing them for a while. The comfort level is decent, but I've had better. \n\nThey also slip off my feet sometimes when I walk around the house, which is super annoying. I kind of expected them to be a bit more snug. The bottom has decent grip, so I haven't slipped yet",

But the comfort level? It's just okay. They feel nice when you first put them on, but after a while, they kind of lose their shape and support. \n\nThe inner lining is soft, sure, but it feels almost too thin, and I worry about durability.
