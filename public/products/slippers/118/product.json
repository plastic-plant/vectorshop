After a couple of wear they just look worn out. Not warm and cushy like I thought, more like walking on a cold floor. Took forever to arrive too. Seriously disappointed. Wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Save your cash!",

Tried to use 'em for a few days but my feet hurt after a hour. Plus, they look cheap and the color faded right away. Really disappointed\u2026 won't ever buy again!",
