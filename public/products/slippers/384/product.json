The comfort was decent at first, but after wearing them for a few hours, they start to feel kinda flat and lose their bounce. The material feels a bit cheap, and I've noticed some loose threads already. They do keep my feet warm, which is a plus, but not great if you have sweaty feet because it can get warm inside. \n\nI also wish they offered more arch support; my feet sometimes ache",

The design is nice and they look good on my feet, but the comfort isn't really what I expected. They feel a bit stiff and take a while to break in. \n\nAlso, the sole isn\u2019t as cushioned as I would have liked. I don\u2019t feel much support when I walk around the house for longer periods. They keep my feet warm, which is a plus, but I just wish",

The cushioning is decent, and it feels nice at first, but after a bit, they start to flatten out. Also, they get really warm, which is fine for winter but definitely too hot in the summer. The foot support isn\u2019t as good as I hoped, and I can feel some pressure points after wearing them for a while. They look nice and the color options are cool, though.",

The soft fabric is pleasant on my feet, but I found the sizing a bit off. I usually wear a medium, but these feel slightly tight. After wearing them for a while, my toes start to feel cramped, which isn't the best for lounging at home.\n\nThe design is pretty cute, not gonna lie, but",
