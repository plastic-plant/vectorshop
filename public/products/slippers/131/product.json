The fluffy material feels nice and soft, but after wearing them for a while, they don't really provide much support for my arches. \n\nThe design is cute, but I noticed that the color started to fade a bit after a few washes, which is kind of disappointing. Another point: they slip off my heels sometimes, which can be annoying when I\u2019m just trying to walk around the house.",

The material is definitely soft, and they feel pretty cozy when you first put them on. However, I find them slipping off my heels too often, which is super annoying.\n\nThe interior cushioning is decent, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as supportive as I\u2019d hoped. After a while, my feet start to feel a little achy. I also noticed they don\u2019t keep my feet",

Son c\u00f3modas, eso no se puede negar, pero no son tan c\u00e1lidas como esperaba. A veces siento que se resbalan un poco en el suelo, lo cual me hace dudar cuando camino r\u00e1pido. El dise\u00f1o es bonito, me gusta, pero el material no es tan resistente como cre\u00eda, ya se nota",

They feel soft and cozy at first, but after wearing them for a while, they kinda lose that plush feel. The size is a bit off too; I thought they\u2019d fit better. I ordered my usual size, but they felt a bit tight. The design looks great, though, so at least they check that box. For the price, I was hoping for more comfort and durability.
