            "review": "These slippers are the worst! They don't fit right at all. I thought I\u2019d get something comfortable, but they are tight and I keep slipping out of them. Also, the sole feels flimsy, like I'll just step outside and ruin them in a second. Real pain to wear. The fabric itches too! What a waste of money. Never buying again. Total disappointment.",

            "review": "Terrible! I was so excited to try these, but what a let down. The fit is off, they're too tight and then way too loose. They fall off my feet when I walk! Not comfortable at all, I feel like I'm walking on bricks. Plus, they started shedding fur or something after just one wear. Seriously annoyed. Save your money, don\u2019t waste it on this!",

            "review": "Honestly, these slippers are a complete letdown. They feel super cheap and quickly lose shape. I expected comfort, but they are uncomfortable and don\u2019t stay on my feet. The sizing is way off too \u2013 I\u2019m usually a size medium but these are huge! Wasted my money, would not recommend to anyone. Even the color is meh. Save your cash and look elsewhere.",

            "review": "These are the worst slippers ever. They are super uncomfortable and honestly feel cheap. My feet hurt after just a few minutes of wearing them. The fabric is scratchy and it doesn\u2019t even keep my feet warm. Plus, they slipped off so easily that I almost tripped twice. I thought they\u2019d be cozy like they claim, but they totally missed the mark. Don't waste your money on this junk. I regret buying them.",
