I like how they look, and the color options are nice, but they don\u2019t feel super durable. Also, they\u2019re a bit slippery on smooth floors, which isn\u2019t great. Overall, they work but didn\u2019t blow my mind. I guess I expected more for the price. Size was true to fit,",

Putting them on feels nice at first, but after a while, they kind of lose their comfy feel, like the cushioning isn\u2019t that great. They also feel a bit small, even though I got my usual size. The material is nice but not as breathable as I hoped, my feet get sweaty sometimes. I think I expected more for the price. They aren't",
