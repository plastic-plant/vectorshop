It felt nice at first, soft and fluffy, but after a few nights, it just flattened out and lost all support. My neck has been hurting more than usual, and I\u2019m constantly waking up feeling restless. \n\nAlso, I was expecting some sort of cooling effect, since that\u2019s what they advertised, but it feels just as warm as my old pillow.

It felt nice when I unboxed it, but honestly, it\u2019s too soft\u2014like I'm sinking into a marshmallow! I wake up sore most mornings, so it\u2019s kinda disappointing. Also, it has a weird smell that just won\u2019t go away, even after I let it air out for days. It\u2019s kind of annoying. I've tried flipping it and adjusting, but no luck.",
