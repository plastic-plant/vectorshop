I wake up with aches sometimes, and that's not what I expected. The cover also feels a bit cheap, and it\u2019s not very breathable, which means I get too hot during the night. The shape isn\u2019t quite right for me either\u2014it just flattens out after a few hours. I thought I could look past some of",

I hoped the memory foam would mold to my neck but it didn\u2019t really help at all. Plus, it ended up getting kind of hot during the night, which made it hard to sleep comfortably. I also noticed some weird smell when I first took it out of the package. I aired it out, but it took days to",

En plus, la taille n\u2019est pas comme sur les photos, je m\u2019attendais \u00e0 quelque chose de plus grand.

I\u2019ve had it for a few weeks, and it\u2019s basically like sleeping on a pancake now. I thought the cooling feature would help, but it's not really doing anything special.
