The first couple of nights seemed okay but after that, I started waking up with neck pain. It feels kinda flat even after I fluff it, and honestly, it holds heat too much for me. I thought it would be softer, more comfy, but it\u2019s just not that great. \n\nAlso, the cover is kinda cheap feeling\u2014just doesn\u2019t feel fancy at all. I guess lots",

It's way too soft, like I'm sinking into a cloud, which sounds nice but ends up giving me neck pain. I thought it would be supportive enough but I woke up with stiffness every day. And the smell when I first opened it was kind of gross. Took a few days to air out. I wanted to love it, but I just can't recommend it. Kind of disappointed overall.",

Sort of flat even after a few nights of use. I wake up with neck pain, which isn\u2019t great. It looks nice, but for the price, I expected way more comfort. It's just too soft without enough support. I guess I should\u2019ve read the reviews better. Just doesn\u2019t live up to what I wanted",

It feels kind of flat and doesn\u2019t provide enough support for my neck. I wake up with sore spots, which is the opposite of what I wanted. Plus, it gets too hot while I sleep, and I wake up sweating sometimes. Really expected more, but it just doesn't do anything special for me. Not sure I'd recommend it to others.",
