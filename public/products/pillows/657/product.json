I usually have a hard time finding a pillow that feels just right, but this one\u2019s been a game changer for my sleep routine. I noticed that I wake up with less neck pain, which is a huge plus!\n\nThe cooling feature is nice, especially during hot summer nights. I also like the design; it looks really sleek on",

The cooling feature does work pretty well too, which is a huge plus for me. I like how you can also adjust it to your liking by adding or removing some filling. However, I expected it to be a bit fluffier. Overall, it\u2019s solid for the price and definitely better than my old pillow! Worth 4 stars",

The materials feel nice and have just the right amount of softness while still offering support.\n\nI do find it a tad on the high side, so if you like a flatter pillow, this might not be for you. My neck felt a little odd the first couple of nights, but I gradually got used to it. The cooling feature",
