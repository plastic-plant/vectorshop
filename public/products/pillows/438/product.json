            "review": "The pillow is pretty average to me. It\u2019s soft, yes, but not as supportive as I hoped. Sometimes I wake up with a sore neck. The cooling tech is kinda nice, but I don\u2019t find it dramatically different from my old pillow. I think it\u2019s okay for the price, but it\u2019s just not my favorite. Takes some getting used to for sure. It looks good on my bed at least, so there's that. Just don\u2019t expect it to blow your mind.",

However, I started to notice that it kind of flattens out after a few nights. Not great if you need support. I also think it gets kinda warm during the night, so I woke up more than I\u2019d like. Overall, it\u2019s okay for short naps, but I wouldn\u2019t rely on it for a full night",

Sometimes my neck feels great, and other times I wake up with a kink. I like the cooling cover, but it doesn\u2019t stay cool long enough for my liking. It also feels a bit too firm given its fluffiness, which is weird? I thought it would mold to my head better.",
