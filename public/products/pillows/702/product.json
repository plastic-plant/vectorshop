It has a nice balance between softness and support, which makes it great for both stomach and side sleepers. The cloud-like comfort really helps ease my neck tension, and I found myself sleeping through the night without waking up to readjust.\n\nThe material feels high quality, and I love that it's breathable; I didn't wake up feeling too hot like I have with other pillows.
