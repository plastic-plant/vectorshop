Woke up with a sore neck every morning. I thought it would be comfy but it feels like sleeping on a rock! Also, the cover started peeling after just a week. Def don\u2019t recommend it. Save your money, you\u2019ll regret it if you buy this. Such a let down.",

I thought maybe it would fluff up after a few uses but nope, it just gets worse. The materials seem cheap, and it smells funny too. I can't even get comfortable no matter what position I try to sleep in. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, total waste of money. Seriously, look elsewhere.",

The material feels cheap too, like it\u2019s gonna rip apart. I tried fluffing it but nothing helps. Very disappointing. I regret buying it, wasted my $ on this. Just go for something else, anything is better than this!",
