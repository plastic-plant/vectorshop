I wake up with a stiff neck every morning. Also, it gets really hot. I thought it would be breathable, but it feels like I'm sleeping on a brick.

I woke up with neck pain and that's never fun. The cooling feature sounded great, but I didn\u2019t notice much of a difference \u2013 I still felt warm. Maybe I expected too much, but it hasn\u2019t delivered what I was hoping for. I guess it might work for others, but it\u2019s just",
