First off, it feels too firm for my liking, not soft and cozy like I thought it would be. There\u2019s no real support either; my neck was still sore in the morning. The cover doesn\u2019t feel premium at all, kinda scratchy, like something you'd find at a budget store. I expected it to be breathable, but I woke up sweating a few times",

I wake up with a sore neck every morning, and that\u2019s a bummer. Also, it gets kinda warm, which makes it hard to sleep sometimes. Sure, it looks nice on my bed, but it just doesn\u2019t work as well as I wanted it to. I think there are better options out there for the price. Overall, not terrible",

Too firm and it didn\u2019t mold to my neck like I thought it would. I woke up with a sore neck a few times. The cooling feature? Didn\u2019t really notice it, either. Just kinda sits there... Could be better. I doubt I\u2019ll be using it much more. Not worth the price, in my opinion",

Quando fui deitar, senti que n\u00e3o apoiava a cabe\u00e7a direito, como se n\u00e3o tivesse firmeza. Acabei me movendo todo e s\u00f3 consegui dormir bem depois de algumas tentativas frustrantes. \n\nOutra coisa, o material n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o bom, parece meio barato e n\u00e3o \u00e9 fresquinho.

It's too fluffy, like it's trying to be a cloud or something, but it just ends up being uncomfortable. I wake up with a stiff neck almost every morning. Plus, it lacks support when I actually try to sleep on it properly. It's hard to get comfy! The cover feels nice, but once I'm in bed, it just doesn't do the job. I found myself switching back to my old pillow a",
