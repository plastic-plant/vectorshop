The shape doesn't really hold up when you sleep on it, and I find myself adjusting it a lot during the night. It looks nice on the bed, but I wish it was a bit firmer. \n\nThe material feels nice to the touch, but I\u2019m not sure it justifies the price. For some reason, it\u2019s also oddly warm, and",

Manchmal f\u00fchle ich mich nicht wirklich gut unterst\u00fctzt, vor allem beim Nacken. Die Qualit\u00e4t sieht in Ordnung aus, aber ich h\u00e4tte mehr f\u00fcr den Preis erwartet. Die Farbe ist h\u00fcbsch und passt gut zu meiner Wohnung, das muss ich sagen. Also, es ist nicht schlecht, aber auch nicht das beste",

I mean, it feels nice to lay down on, but by morning, I often wake up with a bit of stiffness. It\u2019s not super easy to fluff either, which can be frustrating when I want to get it right.\n\nI appreciate the design and the color choices, but honestly, it could be more versatile.

The softness is pretty decent, and it does give some decent support at times, but I've had issues with it flattening out after a while. I expected better durability for the price, you know? It\u2019s comfy for naps, but when I sleep on it all night, I wake up with a sore neck. The cover is soft, but kind of hard to wash, and it",

The design is nice, and it looks good on the couch, but for comfort, it falls short. It offers some support, but I found it too flat for my liking. It doesn\u2019t quite hold up after a few weeks of use, and I expected more given the hype. A little too stiff and not soft enough for my needs. But it\u2019s not terrible; I",
