The lumbar support isn't what you'd expect; it feels more like a gentle poke than any real support. The seat cushion is losing its shape, and I find myself feeling uncomfortable after sitting for too long. \n\nThe armrests feel cheap and wobble a bit, which is distracting when I'm trying to work. I was hoping it would help",

The cushioning is just not enough; after a few hours, my back really starts to hurt. The seat is shallow too\u2014it feels like I'm sitting on the edge all the time.\n\nAlso, the assembly was a pain. The instructions didn't make much sense, and some of the pieces felt flimsy. I was worried",

First off, the padding isn\u2019t as plush as I expected; it feels a bit too stiff, like it forgot to be soft. The back support isn\u2019t great either, I find myself slouching after a couple of hours. Adjustments are kind of awkward too, it took me a while to figure out how to even raise it. The wheels are squeaky, which is annoying when I'm",
