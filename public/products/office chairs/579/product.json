After a few hours, I was already feeling sore. The cushioning feels cheap and hard. \n\nAlso, the adjustments are pretty clunky. You have to mess around with levers and knobs just to find a decent height, and even then it doesn\u2019t stay in place well. Plus, the arms are too stiff and don\u2019t move as",

The cushioning feels quite thin, and after sitting for a couple of hours, I already started feeling uncomfortable. The back support isn\u2019t what they advertise. It feels a bit too rigid, which doesn't help when you're trying to focus on work. Adjusting the height works, but the recline feature feels awkward and doesn't hold if you lean back a bit too much.",

At first, I was excited to have something that looked classy in my office, but then I noticed some major issues. The cushioning is not as supportive as I expected; it feels like I'm sitting on a rock after a few hours. The adjustments are confusing and don't seem to hold well either. \n\nI find myself constantly resetting the height because it drops down when I lean back, which is super annoying.",

The seat isn\u2019t very padded and starts to hurt my legs after a while. Adjustments are annoying; I find them really stiff and it's hard to get it just right. Plus, I wish the armrests were better positioned, they kinda get in the way. The look is alright, but comfort is priority for me, and this just doesn't cut it.",

The seat got uncomfortable after just a couple hours, and I find myself shifting around a lot trying to get comfy. \n\nThe armrests are too wobbly and feel cheap, like they might break if I lean on them too much.
