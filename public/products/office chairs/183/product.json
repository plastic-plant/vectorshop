            "review": "this chair is awful. I thought it would be comfy for working long hours but it really isn't. the cushions are hard and I feel like I'm sitting on a rock. Im also not sure who designed the height adjustment because it won\u2019t stay in place. wheels don't roll smooth, just gets stuck all the time. I wish I could return it. total waste of money. Steer clear of this one.",

            "review": "After hearing all the hype, I got this chair expecting comfort and support, but I was let down big time. It's like sitting on a rock! No padding at all, just hard plastic. The backrest is wobbly and doesn't support my back. I thought the adjustable height would help, but it just sinks as soon as I sit down. Really frustrating! I'm always in pain after a long workday now. Honestly, I regret my purchase. Would not recommend it at all. Waste",

Sitting on it feels like I\u2019m sinking right in, not comfy at all. The cushion is too hard and it aches my back after an hour. Plus, I\u2019ve been having trouble with the wheels. They don\u2019t glide, they stick. Honestly, I wish I had saved my money. I\u2019ll be looking for something else. Super disappointed",

Und das Material? F\u00fchlt sich billig an und sieht auch so aus. Ich hab mehr erwartet f\u00fcr den Preis. W\u00fcrde ich nicht empfehlen! Habe ihn gleich zur\u00fcckgeschickt.
