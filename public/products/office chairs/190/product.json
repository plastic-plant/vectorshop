The first thing I noticed was that the seat isn\u2019t very comfortable. After sitting for a few hours, I felt so sore like I could hardly move. The adjustable features are there but they don\u2019t work as well as I hoped. \n\nI thought I could easily change the height and back support, but it feels pretty stiff and not very responsive. Also, the armrests are positioned weird and",

The design looked impressive online, but in reality, it's not very comfortable for long hours. The cushion isn't great\u2014after sitting for a bit, it feels flat and stiff. I also had a hard time with the adjustments; they were a bit finicky and didn\u2019t stay in place well. \n\nLooks nice but functionality is seriously lacking. Overall, really disappointed.

The adjustable features seem great in theory, but they don't really provide the support I need for long hours at my desk. The cushion felt soft at first, but after only a few weeks, it's kind of flattened out and feels less comfy. \n\nI\u2019ve adjusted it multiple times, but something always feels off, especially in the lumbar area. I thought the design would look sleek in my office, but it's just ok",

After a few hours of sitting, my back starts feeling tired. The adjustability features seem nice but don\u2019t do much for me. It feels like I\u2019m always fiddling with them. \n\nAnd it\u2019s kinda heavy to move around, which is annoying since I like to shift my setup sometimes. Also, the cushion isn\u2019t very plush; it\u2019s pretty stiff.",
