It looks nice and the ergonomic design is nice for my back when I\u2019m sitting all day, but I think it could've been better. The cushions are a bit too firm, which makes it hard to sit for long periods. I also noticed it makes some squeaky noises when I shift around, which is kinda annoying.\n\nThe adjustability is decent, but it takes a bit to find the right angle. I also",

It\u2019s got some decent features like adjustable height and padded seating, which are nice for longer hours at my desk. However, I expected a couple of things to be better for the price point. \n\nThe lumbar support is okay, but it doesn\u2019t really feel like it fits my back right. Sometimes I still feel a bit of discomfort after working for a while. I\u2019ve had better ones that did a more effective",

The lumbar support is decent, but I wish it was a bit more adjustable. Sometimes I feel like I need more cushioning, especially during long hours of work. \n\nThe seat is comfortable enough for short periods, but after a while, I start to feel the pressure. The armrests could use some padding",

The padding isn\u2019t as plush as I hoped, and after a few hours of sitting, I start feeling the hard surface underneath. The lumbar support does help a bit, but sometimes it feels a little too rigid. \n\nAssembly was pretty straightforward, though I had a couple of screws that didn\u2019t seem to fit quite right.
