The brew time is really slow, and I found myself waiting around for my coffee more times than I can count. The taste is okay but nothing special, and some days it's just plain weak. It's also a bit complicated to clean. I thought it'd be easy since there are so many buttons, but ugh, so many parts to take apart. I wish it had a nice,",

The brewing process is really slow. I mean, I'm not asking for instant coffee, but waiting over 10 minutes for a single cup is just too much. Also, it doesn\u2019t maintain the temperature that well. My coffee\u2019s lukewarm by the time I sit down to drink it, which",

The coffee it brews tastes kinda bland, like it's missing a lot of flavor.
