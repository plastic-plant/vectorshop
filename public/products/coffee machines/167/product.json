It takes forever to brew, and half the time, my coffee tastes kinda burnt or flat \u2212 I really don't get it!\n\nAlso, the control panel is confusing. I thought it would be easy to use, but I keep pressing the wrong buttons and ending up with some weird brew cycle. Not cool when all you want",

The brewing process takes forever, and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t make the coffee hot enough. I tried to follow the instructions, but I feel like it just lacks simple usability. The flavor isn\u2019t all that great either. Thought I would get a lovely cup of coffee, but most times I end up disappointed. For the price, you\u2019d expect more. I don\u2019t really",

The brewing process is super slow, taking longer than I expected, and it just doesn\u2019t always get the coffee hot enough. Sometimes I have to reheat it in the microwave, and that\u2019s just not ideal. \n\nAlso, the flavors are kind of hit or miss. I\u2019ve tried different beans, thinking maybe that was the issue",

It looks great on my counter and has all these cool settings, but the performance just isn't there. Sometimes it brews okay coffee, but other times it\u2019s just watered down and not hot enough. The touchscreen is finicky, I find myself tapping it multiple times to get it to work. \n\nPlus, cleaning it is more of a hassle than I thought it would be; the parts don't come apart easily, and",
