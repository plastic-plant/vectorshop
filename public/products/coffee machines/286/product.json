I can\u2019t even get it to turn on half the time. when it does work, the coffee tastes burnt or just plain bad. the settings are confusing and there\u2019s always an error message flashing on the screen. tried to get customer service to help but they were no help either! save your money, it\u2019s not worth it.",

Always messes up my drinks, beans get stuck, and the water never heats right. Takes forever just to get a cup! Super complicated to set up. I just want my morning coffee\u2014this thing just makes me angry. I expected better, but now it just collects dust. Do not recommend at all. Total disappointment.",
