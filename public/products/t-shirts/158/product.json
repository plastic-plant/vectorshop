            "review": "I really regret buying these tees. First the fit is weird, super baggy on the shoulders but tight around the waist. Not comfy at all. The material feels cheap and sorta scratchy. After one wash, they shrunk and now they look like I\u2019m wearing a kids shirt. The colors faded too, was bright in the pic, but now dull and lifeless. Definitely not worth the money. It\u2019s like throwing cash into the fire. I'll stick to my old shirts. Disappointed",

I usually wear a medium, but this felt like a small. Really uncomfortable to wear. The color faded after just 2 washes, and it looked worn-out already. I expected so much more, but this was just a letdown. Save your money!",
