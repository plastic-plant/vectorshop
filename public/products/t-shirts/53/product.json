After a couple of washes, they started fading. Not impressed with the fit either\u2014it\u2019s sort of boxy and doesn't flatter my shape at all. The design looked cool online, but in person, it seemed cheap. Overall, I guess they're okay for wearing around the house, but definitely not worth the price.",

I thought they would fit well, but they\u2019re tighter in some weird places and loose in others. Also, the designs looked amazing online, but they came out kinda dull in person. I\u2019ve seen better quality and fit for the same price, so I don't think I'll be buying these again. Might be a hit for some, but not",

After a few washes, it started to lose its shape a bit, which isn't great. The fit is weird too; didn't know if I should size up or down. And the colors? They look nice online but aren't as vibrant in person. I mean, it\u2019s alright for the price, but I wouldn\u2019t buy again. Feels like a missed opportunity",
