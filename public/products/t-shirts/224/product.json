            "review": "I had high hopes for these t-shirts, but honestly, they've been a letdown. The fabric feels kind of rough, not soft like I expected. After just a few washes, I noticed some stitching coming undone, which is really disappointing. The design looks great at first but starts to fade pretty quickly. It\u2019s a shame because the idea was nice. Sizing runs a bit small too. I\u2019d look elsewhere before buying again.",

Tras unos lavados, ya se ven un poco gastadas y los colores han perdido intensidad. Adem\u00e1s, la talla no es muy fiel; son un poco m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as. El dise\u00f1o es bonito, pero la verdad no justifica lo que pagu\u00e9. No estoy completamente decepcionado, pero no creo que vuelva a comprar de nuevo.",

            "review": "I really wanted to like this t-shirt, but it's just okay. The design looked amazing online, but when I got it, the print wasn't sharp at all\u2014kind of blurry, which was disappointing. The fabric feels a bit cheap, not soft like I expected. The fit is also weird, it's either too tight or too loose in places. I wish it was more flattering, honestly. Probably wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless you\u2019re really into the print or something. Overall, just kinda mediocre.",
