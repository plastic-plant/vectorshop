Sizing was way off too, super tight in places. Construction feels cheap, like it\u2019ll rip any moment. Not worth the money at all. Would not recommend.",

The fit is terrible too, I ordered my size and it\u2019s way too small. The colors look washed out like they already faded. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. save your money!",

Sizing is totally off, super small even though I ordered my usual size. Wasted my money on this\ud83d\ude21. Definitely not buying again. Save your cash!",

After one wash, they shrunk wya too much and now they are almost unwearable. I also found a few loose threads hanging off. The colors are nothing like the pics either, kinda dull and lifeless. Don\u2019t waste your money on these, seriously.",
