The fabric feels kinda cheap, and honestly, it's not as soft as I hoped. After one wash, I noticed some fading and a few loose threads. The fit is also off\u2014it's snug in awkward places and baggy where it shouldn\u2019t be. Plus, I don\u2019t think it breathes well at all; I felt super hot while wearing",

Al\u00e9m disso, a estampa desbotou na primeira lavagem, o que \u00e9 bem frustrante. O tamanho n\u00e3o condiz com o que estava na tabela, comprei um M e ficou bem justo, que \u00e9 um pouco estranho. No geral, n\u00e3o gostei muito. Esperava mais, vale a pena demorar mais buscando",

The sizing is kinda off too\u2014I ordered a large and it fits more like a medium. Had to return it because it was tight around the shoulders. Also, they\u2019re not holding up well after a couple of washes; started to pill up which is super disappointing. I thought I was getting a good deal, but I feel",

I expected something softer and more comfortable, but it's just not there. The fit is also kinda weird; it\u2019s too loose in some areas and tight in others, so I can\u2019t even wear it out casually. I tried washing it hoping for some miracle, but it still feels off.
