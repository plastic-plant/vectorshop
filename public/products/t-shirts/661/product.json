The fit is off; it's not as comfortable as I thought it would be, and the fabric feels a bit cheap. I expected better quality for the price. Also, the colors are way too different from what was shown online. I've washed them a few times, and they just don't hold up. It's frustrating because I wanted to love them. Overall, not worth it in my opinion.",

Apr\u00e8s quelques lavages, ils se d\u00e9forment d\u00e9j\u00e0, et les couleurs s\u2019estompent rapidement. J'esp\u00e8re que ce n'\u00e9tait qu'un mauvais lot, mais j'avais plus d'attentes. En plus, la taille ne correspond pas vraiment, le L est plus petit que d'habitude ! \u00c0 peine port\u00e9 et j\u2019ai des doutes",

I expected them to be soft and comfy, but they feel kinda scratchy, and I found some loose threads after a couple of washes. The colors are nice but fade pretty quickly. Overall, not worth the price I paid. Wouldn\u2019t buy again.",

The fabric feels kind of cheap and scratchy, and after a few washes, they started to lose their shape. The fit is a bit off too; it\u2019s either too tight in some places or too loose in others. I was hoping for something a little more stylish, but I just end up wearing them around the house. Not sure I\u2019ll be buying again, sadly. Just not what I expected.",

Plus, the sizing is off. I ordered a medium, but it fits more like a small. I can barely move in it! The designs are cool, but they started to crack after just one wash. \n\nThe colors are nice, but what good is a nice color if it\u2019s not comfy? Overall, it",
