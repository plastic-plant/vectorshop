Nach ein paar W\u00e4schen (und ich folge schon den Anweisungen!) hat das Material angefangen zu pillen. Auch die Passform ist nicht optimal, sie sitzen nicht wirklich gut und tragen sich eher unangenehm. Ich hatte erwartet, dass sie sich weicher anf\u00fchlen, aber das Gegenteil ist der Fall. Schade eigentlich, denn das Design war wirklich ansprechend.",

The fabric feels kind of scratchy instead of comfy, and after one wash, they shrank more than I expected. The prints looked cute online, but in person, they aren't that vibrant. They also fit a bit weird around the armpits, which is uncomfortable. I tried to like them, but I\u2019ll probably just wear them around the house. Definitely not the best purchase I've made",

            "review": "I was really expecting more from these t-shirts. The fabric feels kinda cheap and thin, like it might rip easily. I washed it once and there\u2019s already some pilling! The fit is off too; it\u2019s a bit boxy and just doesn\u2019t flatter me. The designs looked great online but on the shirt, they\u2019re kinda faded and don\u2019t pop at all. I thought the price was reasonable, but now I see it was because the quality isn\u2019t really there. Disappointing",

After only one wash, it started to look worn out. I was excited to wear these out, but they don't fit quite right either; kind of boxy and awkward. I tried to reach out for customer service, but got no response. Overall, not the best experience for the price. Wouldn't really recommend it",
