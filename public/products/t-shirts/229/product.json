Customer service took a bit of time to respond, which was frustrating. They look nice but I\u2019ve had better made shirts in my closet. Not terrible, but not great either. I\u2019ll probably",

I expected something a bit more breathable for the warmer weather. The designs are fun and colorful, which I like, but the sizing is a bit off. I got a large thinking it\u2019d be loose, but it fits more like a medium. It\u2019s okay overall, just not exactly what I was looking for, you know?  They wash well",
