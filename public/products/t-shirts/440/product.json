The fabric feels nice at first, but it\u2019s not as soft as I expected after a few washes. The fit is average\u2014I was a bit disappointed because it\u2019s kind of snug in weird places. I don\u2019t mind it for everyday wear, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d reach for on a weekend out. It looks decent, but nothing too special. Overall, not bad, just",

The fabric feel is nice and soft, but after a couple of washes, it has started to lose its shape. Colors are good, but not as vibrant as I thought they would be. Sizing runs a bit small too, so keep that in mind if you like your tees a bit looser. It fits fine but hugs more than I like.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s wearable but",
