Fabric feels cheap and scratchy, I thought it would be soft based on the pics. I wore it once and there\u2019s already pilling all over. The colors faded after one wash, looked so bad I almost threw it out. I really can\u2019t recommend this to anyone. Wasted my money.",

The sizing is off too, it\u2019s either too tight or way too loose. I tried wearing one, and I've never been so uncomfortable. Plus, the colors faded after the first laundry. Seriously, I don\u2019t get how anyone could like these. Waste of money for sure. Never again.",

After just one wash, the color faded so bad it looks like it's from a thrift store. The fit is all wrong, way too tight in some places and super loose in others. Not even worth the money I spent. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Save your time and cash!",

After one wash the seams started to fray, and now there are little holes all over. Also, the fit is way off \u2013 too tight in some places, and way too loose in others. Not even comfortable to wear around the house. Very disappointed. Def not worth the money I spent. Save your cash people!",
