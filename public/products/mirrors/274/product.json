Reflections are all askew, and it looks cheap too, not elegant at all. The lights are way dim and hardly even work. Just made my room look worse. I tried to reach out to customer service but got no reply after days of waiting. Really disappointed. Save yourself the trouble and find something else.",

Had weird smudges right outta the box and I tried cleaning it but still looked dirty?? Not what I expected at all. Plus, it doesn\u2019t even hang straight on my wall. I totally regret buying this. Save your money \u2013 look elsewhere!",

Plus, the lights are way too dim. I thought it would help me get ready, but it just makes everything look worse. Not worth the money at all. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. So frustrated I even bought this. Save your cash!",

Made me look like a funhouse character or something. The light doesn't even work half the time, so I'm stuck staring at myself in dim light like it's the dark ages. Not worth the money at all. I expected better quality. Disappointed big time. Save your cash and look for something else. Wish I could give it zero stars.",
