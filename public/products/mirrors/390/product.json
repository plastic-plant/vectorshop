The lighting is decent, but sometimes it feels a bit harsh. I like that it\u2019s got a sleek design, and it fits well in my room. However, the smart features don\u2019t always work like they should; I struggle with the touch controls quite often and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t respond. \n\nThe reflection is clear,",

The reflection quality is decent, but I expected it to be much clearer. The interface can be confusing, and I've spent more time trying to get it to do what I want than actually using it. Sometimes it lags and takes a bit to respond, which is kind of annoying when you're in a hurry. \n\nThe ambient lighting is a nice touch, but it could use better adjustment",

The clarity is decent and it does the job for my daily routines, but I expected more from a mirror at this price point. Sometimes, the light feature can be a bit finicky, so I have to tap it a couple of times to get it to turn on. The design is nice, and it looks pretty sleek in my bathroom, but it\u2019s just missing that wow factor",

The design is nice, sleek, and fits well in our bathroom, but it seems like it doesn\u2019t always reflect properly. Sometimes, the brightness is off, and it's frustrating when I\u2019m trying to get ready in the morning.

I mean, it's fun to see this reflected image of myself, but the quality isn't as good as I expected. Sometimes the rendering is off, and I notice some pixelation, which can be distracting. \n\nAlso, it can be a bit slow to load, especially when switching between different settings or moods.
