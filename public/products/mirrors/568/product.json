The reflective quality isn't great; I can't tell if it's just weaker light or what, but sometimes it feels like I\u2019m looking through a foggy window. Plus, it has this weird distortion on the edges that makes me look... um, not exactly how I should (I swear I don't look that way in real life!). \n\nAnd",

I can see myself, sure, but it\u2019s kind of dim and warped in spots. \n\nThe design looks nice, I guess, but the frame feels flimsy. It wobbles a bit when I try to adjust the angle. Plus, there are some annoying fingerprints all the time that won\u2019t come off easily.",

The reflective quality isn\u2019t as clear as I expected, and it kind of distorts my face. Also, the touch controls can be really sensitive\u2014it\u2019s more trouble setting things up than it\u2019s worth. I found myself wishing I had gone for something more basic. It's decent but not really a keeper. I feel like there are better options out there at this price point, so I\u2019m a bit disappointed",
