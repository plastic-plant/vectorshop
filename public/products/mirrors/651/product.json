Super cheap feel too, not worth the price at all. Packing was bad when it arrived, and it took forever to get here. I've had better ones for half the price at the store. Wish I could return it but dealing with that mess is more hassle than this mirror is worth. Save your money!!!",

It's really cheap looking too, and the light just stopped working after a week. I can barely use it now. Not worth the money at all, total waste. I expected better quality for what I paid. Would not recommend!",
