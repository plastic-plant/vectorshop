Such a waste of money! The shelves are all flimsy, and the design is super confusing. The buttons don\u2019t work half the time. I tried to contact support but got no help. Seriously regretting this purchase, would not recommend, super disappointed!",

I opened it up after a few hours and everything was warm, like really warm. Bought some nice meats and they spoiled. So frustrating!! \n\nPlus, the ice maker jams all the time, had to pull it apart like 5 times already. Just a poor design I guess. It sounds like a truck when its running and it takes forever to chill",

And don\u2019t even get me started on the design, it looks cheap and flimsy. Plus, door doesn\u2019t close right so everything inside spills out if you hit it gently. I regret buying. Waste of money. Id give it zero stars if I could.",
