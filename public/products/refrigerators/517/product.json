Total waste of space! Stuff falls over all the time. The noisy hum drives me crazy, like it\u2019s always working overtime but not doing anything right. I even had ice meltiing all over the place once! Such a headache. Seriously, save your money and look for something else. I'm so disappointed.",

They\u2019re flimsy and keep falling out. I can't even fit a pizza box! The build feels cheap, like, it won\u2019t last long for sure. I\u2019m super disappointed. It was a waste of money! Wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Just save your cash and get something better!",

            "review": "I bought this fridge and it\u2019s a total dud. The ice maker barely works and it\u2019s freezing everything. Food always gets frostbite even when I turn the temp way up. The doors don\u2019t seal right, and it keeps buzzing like it's dying. Tried to get help from customer service but they are useless. It barely keeps stuff cold and the shelves are super flimsy. Never buying anything from this brand again. Save your money.",

            "review": "I regret buying this fridge. It barely cools anything, everything inside goes bad way too fast. The ice maker doesn\u2019t work, spills water everywhere. Can't even keep a gallon of milk cold. Noise level is ridiculous too, like it\u2019s trying to compete with a jackhammer. And I don\u2019t even have space to fit anything inside. Super disappointed, I wish I could return it. Really bad choice, avoid at all costs.",

The shelves are so cheap and feel like they might break any minute. Wish I\u2019d just spent a little more for something that actually works. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",
