The inside is so small, I can barely fit anything in there. Also, it's super loud like a broken engine. I tried to get customer service, but they were no help. They just keep putting me on hold for ages. Wish I could return it, but I'm stuck now. Definitely do NOT recommend!",

I bought it hoping it would do the job but everything spoils way too fast. it makes weird noises too, like it's gonna give up on me any moment. \n\nthe layout inside is awful, i can't fit my stuff. there\u2019s not even a good shelf for my drinks. and why does it have to be so loud? ugh. \n\nsave your money, go for a better one",

I swear I've had better luck with a cooler. It's too loud too. Makes these weird noises all the time! Plus, the shelves are way too small; can't fit a normal pizza box without taking stuff out. Delivery took ages too. Do yourself a favor and skip this. I'm going back to my old one. 1 star is way too",

Heb \u2018m nu al een maand en alles is al rommelig en plakkerig. Gemiste kans, mijn oude koelkast deed het veel beter. Echt zonde van m\u2019n geld, enveloppe met koelkast wordt zolang!",
