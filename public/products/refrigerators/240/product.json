            "review": "I have mixed feelings about this refrigerator. It's pretty sleek and looks great in my kitchen, but that's where the excitement ends. The cooling is decent, but not as strong as I expected, and I've noticed some strange noises coming from it at times, which can be a bit unnerving. The storage space is alright, but the layout feels a little cramped for larger items. There are moments when I wish the shelves were adjustable.

The space is decent, but somehow it feels cramped compared to my old one. I wish the shelves were more adjustable since I have some tall items to fit in.\n\nThe smart features are kinda cool, but honestly, I don\u2019t use them much.

            "review": "De koelkast ziet er modern uit, maar er zijn wel wat puntjes waar verbetering mogelijk is. Hij houdt de spullen aardig koel, maar niet helemaal zo goed als ik had gehoopt. De indeling is een beetje onhandig, vooral de groentela. Er is ook een wat vervelende piep als de deur open blijft, dat kan irritating zijn. En ik vind het jammer dat er geen goede aansluitingen zijn voor flesjes. Het is een redelijke aankoop, maar verwacht niet te",
