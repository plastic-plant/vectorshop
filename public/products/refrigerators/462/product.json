Die F\u00e4cher sind total unpraktisch und die T\u00fcr schlie\u00dft nicht gut, manchmal bleibt sie einfach offen. Ich hab mehr Geld f\u00fcr die Hoffnung ausgegeben einen guten K\u00fchlschrank zu bekommen, aber jetzt muss ich mir trotzdem einen neuen suchen. Kann ich nicht empfehlen, totaler Schrott.",

I put my drinks in there expecting them to be cold when I take them out, but no, it\u2019s like they\u2019re just sitting in warm water. messed up!!. Also, the shelves fall out all the time. Packed it full and all of a sudden crash \u2013 there go my groceries. Like seriously who thought of this design?? It's so loud",
