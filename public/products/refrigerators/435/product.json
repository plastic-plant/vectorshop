Customer service is non existent \u2013 I tried calling them and no one picked up! The shelves are flimsy and don\u2019t even hold weight. Can\u2019t believe I wasted my money on this thing. Seriously, save yourself the grief and invest in something better. What a nightmare.",

My food goes bad in a couple of days, and I have to keep opening it to see if it\u2019s even still working. The noise it makes is soo annoying too. It\u2019s loud and it starts and stops way too much. I tried calling customer service, but they kept putting me on hold forever. I just want my fridge to be a fridge, is that too much",
