I often find my milk warmer than I like. The layout of the shelves is kind of awkward too; it doesn\u2019t fit a lot of things well, and I end up having to stack stuff in front of each other. \n\nAlso, the noise is pretty annoying. It makes this weird hum that I can",

Sometimes, I find things a bit warm even when other stuff is icy. Also, the layout is weird; I can barely fit my bigger grocery items. The shelves feel cheap and sometimes rattle when I close the door. \n\nEnergy efficiency isn't all that great too, I get higher bills now! And the noise \u2013 ugh! It's louder than",

            "review": "Ik vond dit koelingsapparaat helaas niet zo geweldig. De eerste paar weken werkte het goed, maar daarna begon het te sputteren. De temperatuuraanwijzer klopt nooit en soms moest ik gewoon opnieuw starten om het normaal te laten werken. Best frusterend. De indeling is ook niet ideaal, waardoor grotere artikelen gewoon niet passen. Akoestisch is het nog een heel gedoe, het maakt al snel veel geluid, wat soms echt ongelegen komt. Het heeft potentie",
