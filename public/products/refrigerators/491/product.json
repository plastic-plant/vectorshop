While it keeps my food cold, I\u2019ve noticed some issues with the storage space. The shelves feel cramped, and I can't fit some taller bottles upright. Plus, it\u2019s annoying how noisy it gets sometimes. Like, I expected it to run quietly since it claims to be energy efficient. The smart features are cool, but honestly, they don't always work as well as I'd",

I really appreciate the separate compartments for veggies and dairy, which helps keep everything organized. \n\nHowever, it can be pretty noisy at times, which is annoying, especially at night.
