The layout is weird too, can\u2019t fit normal-sized bottles anywhere. The shelves feel cheap and wobbly. I've also had issues with the door seals, it\u2019s just one problem after another. It also makes weird noises all night like it's haunted or something. Honestly, I regret buying this. Don't waste your money like I did.",
