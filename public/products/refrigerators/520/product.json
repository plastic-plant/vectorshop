The noise level is surprisingly loud at times, especially when it cycles on and off. It keeps my food cold, so it does what it\u2019s supposed to, but I feel like the temperature settings can be a bit off \u2014 sometimes I find ice cream a little too hard to scoop.\n\nStorage space is decent, but not as optimized as I hoped.",

He notado que algunas cosas se congelan y otras no est\u00e1n lo suficientemente fr\u00edas. No es lo que esperaba. Adem\u00e1s, el ruido que hace es algo molesto a veces, especialmente por la noche.\n\nLa capacidad es buena y tiene varios compartimentos \u00fatiles, pero creo que el sistema de control podr\u00eda ser mejor.

The space inside is decent, and it keeps my groceries cold, but I've noticed a few annoying issues.\n\nSometimes, it doesn\u2019t seem to hold the temperature really well. I\u2019ll find my milk getting a bit warmer than I'd like. Also, the shelves are a bit too close together for taller items like drinks. Adjusting them is",

I mean, it looks nice and fits well in my kitchen, but it hasn\u2019t been all that great performance-wise. The cooling is decent but not as quick or efficient as I hoped. Sometimes, I've noticed some weird noises from it, which can be a bit annoying. \n\nThe layout of the shelves is okay, but I think there could be more room for larger items. It does keep the food fresh for the most part",
