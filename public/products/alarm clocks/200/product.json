            "review": "This thing is awful. Got it thinking it would help me wake up, but it just doesn't work. The \"snooze\" feature is a joke. Somehow makes me sleep longer instead of waking me up! Sometimes it doesn\u2019t even go off. It looks cool but it's useless. Wish I could return it. Save your money and get a regular alarm clock. This is just a waste of space.",

I thought it would help me wake up easier but it just makes me more tired. The setup was super complicated and I still can\u2019t figure it out. This thing is just a confusing mess. Trust me, you can do better.",
