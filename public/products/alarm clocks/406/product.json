Setting the time is confusing, and I still can\u2019t figure out how to make it stop snoozing relentlessly. The sound options? They\u2019re not great, a lot of them are just annoying, not relaxing at all. Plus, the light is way too bright for early mornings; it\u2019s more like a spotlight than a gentle wake-up call. Overall, I wanted",

The features sounded great on paper, like the gradual wake up thing and all the nature sounds, but in reality, it just wakes me up too suddenly. The volume is either too low or way too loud\u2014no middle ground. The snooze button is annoyingly small too, I keep hitting the wrong one when I'm still half asleep. Also, the app setup was a hassle, it kept crashing and made my mornings more",

The design is neat, I\u2019ll give it that, but it often doesn\u2019t go off when it\u2019s supposed to. I\u2019ve woken up late a few times because of it, which is super frustrating. The app is confusing and doesn't always sync with the clock. One time, I had it set to go off on a weekday and it totally ignored my settings. Honestly, I expected way more for",

The snooze button is way too hard to press, and sometimes it doesn't even wake me up at the right time! Plus, the sound is not loud enough for my taste \u2013 I often sleep right through it. \n\nThe app that connects to it is kinda clunky, too. Sometimes it won't sync and",
