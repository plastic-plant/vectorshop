Lorsqu'il sonne le matin, la m\u00e9lodie douce est si agr\u00e9able que je n'ai plus envie de le jeter \u00e0 travers la pi\u00e8ce. Les sons de la nature m'apaisent et me mettent de bonne humeur d\u00e8s le r\u00e9veil. La fonction de calage qui joue des accords harmonieux est vraiment innovante et rend mes mornings tellement mieux ! J'aime aussi le r\u00e9glage facile de l'heure et les fonctionnalit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires comme le simulateur de lever",
