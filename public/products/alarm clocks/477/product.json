            "review": "Worst alarm clock ever! Doesn't wake me up at all. The sound is too low even with volume up max. I missed work because of it! Also, the snooze button???? Super annoying. You hit it, but it doesn't even work half the time! The screen is too bright too, makes it hard to sleep. Save your money and invest in something reliable. Total waste of time!",

I hit snooze like 5 times every morning! the screen is way too bright at night, I can\u2019t even sleep. also, the sounds are annoying like some cheap old toy. I expected better quality but it feels super flimsy, like it might break any minute. seriously don\u2019t bother with this.",

            "review": "Deze wekker is echt een grote teleurstelling. Het geluid is veel te zacht en ik hoor het gewoon niet. Zelfs op de hoogste stand! Bovendien blijft de klok steeds op hetzelfde uur staan en soms valt hij gewoon uit. Geen snooze functie die werkt! Ook de app die erbij hoort is traag en begrijp ik niet. Was verwachtingen veel hoger, maar dit is echt geen aanrader. Verspil je geld hier niet aan.",
