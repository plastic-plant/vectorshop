Sometimes I feel like I still have stubble even after going over the same spots multiple times. It lathers up pretty well, but the scent was kind of overpowering for me \u2013 not super pleasant.\n\nIt does feel moisturizing, but I still had some irritation on my sensitive skin. The price point is alright",

It clogs my razor more than I expected, which means way more rinsing and kinda slows down the process. The scent is fine, not too overwhelming but also not super fresh or anything. It's okay for a quick shave, but I wish it offered a bit more moisture. Overall, it's decent but didn",

My skin feels decently smooth after, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as moisturizing as advertised. Sometimes I get small nicks, which can be annoying, especially when I haven't rushed the shave.

It goes on smoothly, and the texture is nice, but I'm not super impressed. The scent is a bit strong for my liking, almost overpowering, which makes it feel like I\u2019m using something that\u2019s more synthetic. \n\nIt gives an okay shave but I\u2019ve had to deal with more nicks and irritation than with my usual cream.
