However, I feel like it doesn't provide that extra glide that I hoped for. I sometimes end up with little nicks, which is not ideal. It's okay for the price, but I've tried better products. It gets the job done but it doesn't quite stand out for me. Wouldn't say it\u2019s a bad choice,",

Sie sch\u00e4umt ganz gut und hat einen angenehmen Duft, aber irgendwie rasiert sie nicht so gr\u00fcndlich wie ich es mir w\u00fcnsche. Manchmal hab ich das Gef\u00fchl, ich muss mehrmals \u00fcberstellen, damit es wirklich glatt wird. Die Pflege danach ist auch mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig.   \nIm Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen erf\u00fcllt sie ihren Zweck, aber ich hatte schon bessere. Preis-Leistung ist auch so lala; ich glaube,",
