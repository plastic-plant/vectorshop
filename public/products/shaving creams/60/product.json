I've used cheaper brands that did way better. Plus, it feels like I'm spreading foam that just doesn't go away. Now I got razor bumps everywhere. Never buying this again. Wish I could get my money back, total waste!",

My skin feels itchy too. What's the point of using it? I\u2019ll be sticking to my old stuff, just wasted my money on this junk. No way I\u2019m buying again.",
