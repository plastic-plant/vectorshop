The cushions get flat super quick like I\u2019m sitting on a pancake, no support at all. And the fabric? It stains way too easy, had a spill and now it looks awful. Took forever to ship too, and it arrived with a ding on the side. Seriously regret this purchase. Would not recommend to anyone. Save your",

I've only had it for a few weeks and there's already a weird smell. Not what I expected for the price. The fabric feels cheap, not what you get in stores. It doesn't fit well in my living room, it takes up too much space and looks awkward. Over all, very disappointing\u2014it\u2019s just a big flop! Would not recommend at",

The cushion is super stiff, not comfy at all. I've had way better seating for less money. Also, it arrived with a scratch on one side. Really, how is that acceptable? It feels like a complete waste of money. Not happy with this purchase, wish I had gone for something else. Would not",
