The fabric is cheap and not like the pictures. I sat down and felt like i was sinking. It's imposible to get up without help. Don\u2019t waste your money! Would NOT recommend this to anyone. Total disaster. Just stick to real couches.",

            "review": "I was really disappointed with this sofa. First off, the cushions are too soft and just sink down when you sit. The fabric feels cheap and is already piling after a few weeks. It\u2019s also way smaller than I expected, not comfy for more than one person. Assembly was a nightmare, nothing fit right. I totally regret this purchase. Save your money and look elsewhere.",
