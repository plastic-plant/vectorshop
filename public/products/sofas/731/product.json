The design is modern, and I love the color options. However, when it comes to comfort, it\u2019s just okay. Sitting on it for long periods isn't the most supportive, and honestly, it could use more cushioning.\n\nAssembly was straightforward, but there were some screws missing, which was",

However, the comfort level isn't as great as I'd hoped. I find myself wanting more cushioning and support after sitting for a while. It feels more like a decor piece than a cozy spot to relax.

Al principio parec\u00eda bien, pero despu\u00e9s de unas horas sentados, se siente un poco duro. La calidad de los materiales tambi\u00e9n deja un poco que desear. Por el precio, esperaba algo m\u00e1s resistente. Al igual que muchos otros he le\u00eddo, a pesar de que tiene buen dise\u00f1o, necesito m\u00e1s confort.
