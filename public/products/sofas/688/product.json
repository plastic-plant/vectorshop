            "review": "I seriously regret buying this sofa. It's SO uncomfortable and not what I expected at all. The cushion feels hard, like sitting on a rock, and I found myself shifting every few minutes. It\u2019s honestly hard to relax on it for more than a few minutes. The fabric also looks cheap and started to pill after a few uses. Plus, the assembly was a nightmare; some screws didn't even fit right. Honestly, I can't reccomend this to anyone. Save your money for something better.",

            "review": "Worst sofa ever. Feels like I'm sitting on a rock. Cushioning is awful, and it\u2019s super uncomfortable. I thought it would be cozy but nope. The material started tearing after a week. Really cheaply made. Assembly was a pain, nothing lined up right and my hands hurt from the screws. I regret buying this. Not worth the money at all. Should have listened to the other reviews. Now I'm stuck with this junk. Choose something else!",

The assembly was a nightmare, the instructions were so vague and stuff didn\u2019t fit right. Plus, after just a few weeks, it\u2019s already sagging. I thought it would hold up better but nope. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. Save your money.",

I thought it was gonna be nice and plush but it\u2019s as hard as a rock. Not worth the money, I regret buying it! Wish I could return it but no luck. Seriously don\u2019t bother, just a waste of time and cash.",
