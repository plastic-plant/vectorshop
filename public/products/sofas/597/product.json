The cushions feel kind of flat, and after sitting for a while, I just want to get up. Also, the fabric isn\u2019t as soft as it appeared in the pictures. It's a bit scratchy, to be honest. Assembly wasn\u2019t a huge hassle, but some pieces didn\u2019t fit together perfectly, which is frustrating",

The cushions feel cheap and don\u2019t hold their shape at all. I received it with some minor scratches too, which was disappointing. It looks great in the living room, but when I sit on it, I just end up shifting around trying to find a comfy spot. Honestly, it definitely has potential, but it needs better quality materials. Wouldn't recommend it",
