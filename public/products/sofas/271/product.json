D'abord, il est confortable pour quelques heures, mais apr\u00e8s on sent la fermet\u00e9, ce qui peut \u00eatre d\u00e9rangeant. La couleur est jolie et facile \u00e0 assortir, mais je remarque d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelques petits \u00e9clats sur le tissu. Si on a des animaux de compagnie, attention, car j'ai l'impression que les poils s'accrochent facilement. Dans l'ensemble, c'est un bon rapport qualit\u00e9-prix",

It looks good in my living room. But then I noticed the comfort isn\u2019t as great as I hoped. It feels stiff, especially when you sit for a long time. I thought it would be softer, like watching a movie with all the comfy vibes, but it\u2019s just okay.\n\nAssembly was not too bad, but there",

The cushions are on the firmer side, which is okay for some people but not really what I was hoping for. \n\nThe fabric looks great, but I can already see it picking up some stains, which is frustrating.
