The fabric is soft and comfortable, which makes it a cozy spot to watch movies or read. I really appreciate the cushions - they\u2019re firm enough to provide good support, but soft enough to sink slightly when you sit down. \n\nSetting it up was a breeze, and it feels quite sturdy. I moved it a few times while decorating, and there hasn't been any",

It's really stylish, and the fabric looks great in my living room \u2013 so many compliments from friends! The cushions are comfy enough for lounging and watching movies, and I've even taken some naps on it.  \n\nAssembly was straightforward; I was able to put it together by myself in about an hour. I should note that the surface can attract pet hair, so if you have fur babies like I do,",
