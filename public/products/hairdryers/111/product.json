The heat settings are nice, but you can definitely feel a difference between the low and high options\u2014like, high is really hot and low barely does anything. Sometimes it makes this weird noise which is kinda annoying.\n\nI appreciate that it\u2019s lightweight and easy to handle, so my arm doesn\u2019t get too tired",

A pot\u00eancia \u00e9 razo\u00e1vel e ele seca o cabelo em um tempo aceit\u00e1vel, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada espetacular. O design \u00e9 bonito e moderno, contudo, a ergonomia poderia ser melhor porque ele fica escorregando da m\u00e3o \u00e0s vezes. Eu esperava mais e ele faz barulho q \u00e9 maior do que eu gostaria.

I like that it's lightweight and easy to handle, which helps during my morning rush. The heat settings are decent, but I wish there was a cool setting that actually worked better. Sometimes it feels a bit too hot, and I'm worried about damage.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me is the cord - it feels a bit short, limiting where I",

The design looks nice, but it feels kind of bulky and heavy after using it for a while. The noise level is a bit loud too, which isn't enjoyable if you're trying to chill in the morning. \n\nThe settings are decent, with multiple heat levels, but I wish it had a cooler shot button to help with styling.",

It does dry my hair pretty quickly, which is great, but the sound it makes is a little loud and kinda annoying. It's lightweight, which is a plus, but sometimes it feels like it has less power than other dryers I've used. \n\nI'm not completely unhappy with the performance, but I didn't find it to be anything super special.
