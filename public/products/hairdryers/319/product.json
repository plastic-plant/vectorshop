Even when I set it on high, my hair was still damp. Super annoying. It's heavy too, way too much effort to hold for long. Also, the cord is so short. I have to stand right next to the outlet. Not worth the money at all. Save your cash and find a better one",

I thought maybe it would get better, but nope. Also, it\u2019s super heavy and hurts my arm. Don\u2019t even get me started on the weird noises it makes, really annoying! I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. Save your money, seriously.",
