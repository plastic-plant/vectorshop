The buttons are so flimsy and I keep turning it off by mistake. Also, it made this weird noise like it\u2019s about to break. No way I\u2019m recommending this to anyone. Total waste of money!",

The heat is not good at all. My hair feel damp forever and I ended up finishing it with a towel. Also, it makes this weird noise that sounds like it's gonna break any second. I've used better ones that are way cheaper. Wish I could get my money back! Don\u2019t waste your money",

Hasn\u2019t even lasted 1 month before it started making weird noises so now I\u2019m stuck with this useless thing. I hoped it would be good but honestly it\u2019s trash. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, save your money for something better! The design is nice but doesn\u2019t matter if it doesn\u2019t work. Just a complete waste!",

Takes forever to dry my hair and it\u2019s supposed to have multiple settings but they all seem the same. It gets hot but not in a good way, I feel like I'm frying my hair. Plus, it\u2019s super loud, like a jet engine or something. Seriously, I regret this purchase. Total waste of money. Just get something else, anything else.",

It overheats super fast and even started to smell weird. The buttons are confusing and I got shocked when I touched it one time. Feels really cheap like a toy. Not worth any money! I regret buying it. Save your cash and find a real hairdryer.",
