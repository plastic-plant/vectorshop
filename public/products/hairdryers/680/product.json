Die Trockenzeit ist nicht so schnell, werd immer noch nasse Spitzen haben, selbst nach l\u00e4ngerer Benutzung. Und das Ger\u00e4usch \u2013 naja, der ist recht laut, aber ich sch\u00e4tze, das ist normal bei Haarf\u00f6hnen. Gut ist, dass er nicht so schwer ist und ich ihn gut halten kann.

The design is nice, and it feels pretty lightweight, which is a plus. When I first tried it, I thought it would dry my hair faster because of the power rating, but honestly, it took the same amount of time as my old one.\n\nThe heat settings are okay, but I\u2019d love to have more control. Sometimes my hair feels a bit friz",

The design is kinda sleek, and it\u2019s not too heavy, which is nice. However, the heat settings are pretty much hit or miss. Sometimes it feels too hot, and other times it's lukewarm, so that\u2019s kinda annoying when you\u2019re trying to style. \n\nNoise level is",

Ele seca o cabelo razoavelmente r\u00e1pido, mas n\u00e3o tem tanta pot\u00eancia quanto eu imaginava. A temperatura tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o boa, \u00e0s vezes fica muito quente, outras muito frio. O design \u00e9 bonito e leve, mas a ergonomia n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o confort\u00e1vel para quem tem cabelo lido. Acaba ajudando, mas poderia ser Muito melhor. Para o pre\u00e7o, achei que era mais, prometia",
