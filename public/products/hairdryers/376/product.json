            "review": "I regret wasting my money on this dryer. It overheats literally after just a few minutes. My hair takes forever to dry. The air is weak and doesn\u2019t do anything, feels like a fancy fan instead. I can\u2019t get it to stay cool, and the controls are so confusing. The cord is way too short, makes it hard to use. I ended up just going back to my old one, it works way better. Not happy at all! Would not recommend to anyone!",
