            "review": "I really wanted to like this backpack, but it just hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations. The design looks cool, but it's not as functional as I hoped. The straps are oddly placed, making it uncomfortable to wear for long periods. I noticed that the zippers are kinda sticky too, which is frustrating when you're in a hurry.
