The zippers keep getting stuck, and the pockets are way too small for anything useful. The straps hurt my shoulders, can't even carry it for long. Also, it looks cheap and not durable at all. Super disappointing. Don't waste your money like I did.",

The pockets are so small, I can barely fit my laptop and a few essentials. Plus, the zipper broke after a week!! \ud83d\ude21 Really disappointing, I expected way better. Save your money and look elsewhere.",

I\u2019m really disappointed, it doesn't hold much and feels cheap. I tried to cram my laptop in, but it barely fits and feels like it\u2019s gonna rip. The pockets are useless, not enough space for my stuff. Would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money for a better one!",

The straps dug into my shoulders and didn\u2019t feel comfortable even with a light load. The zippers jammed constantly and I could barely fit my laptop and books inside. The design is so plain, looks nothing like it did in the pictures. Plus, the pockets are awkwardly placed, it\u2019s hard to get to anything quickly. Save your money, not worth it at all. I",

Other users might say it's comfy, but it's not\u2014hard to carry and just overall a hassle. Plus, zippers get stuck all the time, super annoying. I regret buying. Don\u2019t waste your money.",
