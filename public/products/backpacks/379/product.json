The design looks nice, and at first, it appears to have enough space for all my stuff, but when I started to use it, I found it really awkward to carry. The straps are not comfortable, and I felt like my shoulders were getting sore after just a short trip.  \n\nAlso, the zippers don\u2019t feel very sturdy at all; I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll break soon enough. I guess",

The size is decent, but the materials feel cheap and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not going to hold up for long. The zippers get stuck often, which is super annoying when you're in a rush. Also, yeah, there\u2019s not enough pockets to keep things organized. The straps are kind of uncomfortable too. It looks nice but when you use it, it\u2019s pretty disappointing. I really wanted to love this",

The design looks good at first, but it\u2019s really not comfortable when I wear it for long periods. The straps dig into my shoulders, and the padding isn\u2019t enough to keep me comfortable. Also, the zippers feel cheap and snag easily, which is super annoying when I'm trying to grab my stuff quickly. \n\nIt has some nice pockets for organization, but they\u2019re not as functional as I'd hoped",
