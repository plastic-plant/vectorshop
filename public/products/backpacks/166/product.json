C\u2019est tres l\u00e9ger, mais si tu met trop de choses, tu veux pas le porter longtemps.  Le design est sympa, mais la qualit\u00e9 du mat\u00e9rieu pourrait \u00eatre meilleure.

I can fit my laptop, some books, and personal stuff without too much hassle. The design is sleek, and I get compliments on it all the time.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that could be better. The material feels a bit thinner than I expected, and I worry about it holding up over time.",

Firstly, the straps can get uncomfortable if you\u2019re carrying it for too long. I wish they had more padding. Also, the zipper gets kinda stuck sometimes, which is super",
