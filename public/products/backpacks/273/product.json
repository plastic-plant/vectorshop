The pockets are kind of cramped\u2014ideal for smaller items but tough for bigger stuff like my water bottle or laptop. \n\nThe straps don\u2019t feel as comfy as I hoped either, especially when it's fully loaded. I've even noticed some stitching coming undone after a short time. On the plus side, it is lightweight, and it",

Los compartimentos son suficientes, pero me gustar\u00eda que tuvieran m\u00e1s organizaci\u00f3n para mantener mis cosas en su lugar. He tenido un par de problemas con las costuras que se ven un poco flojas, lo que me hace dudar de su durabilidad a largo plazo. El estilo est\u00e1 bien, aunque no es tan atractivo como otros que he visto por el mismo precio",

After a few hours of wearing it, the straps dig into my shoulders pretty bad, which is disappointing since I liked using it for daily errands. The design looks nice at first glance, but you can tell the material doesn't feel super durable. It's decent for the price, and if you\u2019re just looking for something to toss stuff in,",

I couldn\u2019t fit all my stuff comfortably. The straps are kinda thin, so after a while it hurts my shoulders. It does carry my laptop well, but that\u2019s about it. I also don't like the material too much; it feels cheap and I\u2019m not sure how durable it is. Overall, it's an all-right bag just not",
