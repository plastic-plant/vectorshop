The pockets are useless\u2014can barely fit my water bottle in. Zippers get stuck all the time, and it looks like it'll fall apart any moment. I can't believe I wasted money on this. Definitely not worth it!",

Zippers got stuck right outta the box, like what a waste. There's barely any space inside, I struggle to fit my laptop and books. Things started falling apart within a week, seams coming undone. I expected way more for the price, very disappointed. Not worth it at all, don\u2019t bother.",

I tried to put a water bottle in the side pocket and it doesn\u2019t even fit! The zippers get stuck all the time, and half the time they don\u2019t open all the way. I've already had to sew a seam because it busted open. It's a total waste of money, honestly. Don\u2019t bother with this one. You\u2019ll regret it",
