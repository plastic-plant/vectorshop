            "review": "I really wanted to like this backpack, but it has some major flaws. First off, the space is not as big as I thought. I can barely fit all my school stuff in there, which is super disappointing. The straps are pretty uncomfortable too; they dig into my shoulders when it's full. It looks nice, but when it comes to actually using it, it falls short. Also, the pockets aren\u2019t laid out well, making it hard to find things. Doesn\u2019t seem worth the hype",

            "review": "I really wanted to like this backpack, but it just didn't meet my expectations. The design looked great and it had some cool features, but that's where the good stuff ends. The material feels kind of cheap, and after a few weeks of use, I noticed some fraying on the straps. Also, the back support is not very comfortable, especially when carrying it for a long time.\n\nI thought I could fit all my things easily, but it turns out the main compartment is smaller than I expected",
