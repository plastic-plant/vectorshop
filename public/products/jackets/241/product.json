Oh and don\u2019t get me started on how it did NOT keep me warm at all!! just a big letdown, wasted my money. save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.",

Not to mention it's not waterproof at all, got soaked in light rain. Pockets don\u2019t zip, everything just falls out. Material feels cheap, like a trash bag! Can't believe I bought this. Seriously don't waste your money like I did.",
