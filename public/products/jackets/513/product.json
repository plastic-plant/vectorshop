            "review": "I was really excited to try this jacket based on the hype, but honestly, it's kind of a letdown. The material feels cheap and lightweight, like it won't hold up against actual weather elements. It looks nice, but that's about it. The sizing runs small, I usually wear a medium and the medium was super tight \u2013 not comfortable at all. The pockets are practically useless, they barely fit my phone. I expected more protection from the elements, especially for the price. Overall, not impressed",

            "review": "I had high hopes for this jacket because of the features it promised, but honestly, it didn't live up to the hype. The materials feel a bit cheap, and I was expecting better quality for the price. The fit is pretty off too; it\u2019s either too tight or too baggy in all the wrong places, making it really uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. I also found it to be not as weather-resistant as advertised. It kept me warm, but a light rain left me",

It feels a bit tight in the shoulders and loose everywhere else. Not super comfortable for movement, which is a bummer since I wanted something I could wear out and about. \n\nAlso, I expected it to be more weatherproof. I got caught in a light rain and it soaked right through. Didn't keep me warm either, so",
