It keeps me somewhat dry in light rain, but when it pours or if it\u2019s really windy, I still end up feeling damp. The fit is decent, though I found it\u2019s a bit snug around the shoulders when I reach for things. The pockets are good, but they could be deeper; stuff tends",

While it does keep me somewhat dry on light rainy days, it just doesn't hold up in heavier downpours. The material feels nice and looks good, but it doesn\u2019t offer the warmth I expected, especially when the wind kicks in. \n\nThe fit is okay, but I found it to be slightly",

On one hand, it looks trendy and serves its purpose of keeping me somewhat warm. The fabric feels decent and it\u2019s got some cool features like zipped pockets and adjustable cuffs. \n\nHowever, I was expecting it to handle the rain a lot better. I got caught in a light shower and was left feeling damp, which was disappointing. Also, the fit is a bit",

I was caught in a light rain, and I still ended up damp. The fit is nice, though. It's comfy enough and looks stylish when I\u2019m just running errands. But I wish the pockets were roomier; they\u2019re a bit tight for my phone and keys. Overall, it works, but I\u2019ve had better. Not exactly what I expected",
