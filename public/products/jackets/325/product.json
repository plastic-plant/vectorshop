It doesn\u2019t keep me as warm as I had hoped, especially when it's windy outside. The fit is off too, it's either too loose or too tight in strange areas. The pockets are super shallow; my phone keeps falling out! I mean, for the price, I expected a lot better. I guess you get what you pay",

On a chilly day, I still felt the cold creeping in. The fabric is kind of flimsy too; I was expecting something a bit sturdier for the price. \n\nOne other big issue is that the pockets are small and not very practical. I can't fit my phone or keys in there without them falling out. The fit is off",

The material feels kinda flimsy, and it doesn't keep me warm at all, which is surprising for a jacket. The fit is also a bit off; it's tight in some places and loose in others. I thought the design was cool, but practicality is more important. The pockets are too small for anything useful, and they aren\u2019t placed well. It\u2019s such a shame because it looks great, but it",

It claims to be lightweight and protective, but honestly, I felt kinda uncomfortable wearing it. The material feels cheap and scratchy against the skin, not soft like I expected. \n\nAlso, the pockets are pretty useless. They\u2019re too shallow, and stuff keeps falling out.

I've tested it outdoors a few times, and the wind cuts right through it. It also doesn\u2019t fit quite right \u2013 kind of tight in the shoulders but loose around the waist.
