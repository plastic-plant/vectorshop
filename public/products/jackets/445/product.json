Also, it\u2019s not very warm at all; I honestly feel colder when I wear it. The fit is off, too \u2013 it\u2019s way too tight in the shoulders but loose everywhere else, which is super uncomfortable. I was hoping it would be a decent layer for outdoors, but I find myself reaching for my old jacket instead. The pockets are positioned weird",

First off, the fit is pretty weird\u2014it\u2019s tight in some places and loose in others. Not flattering at all. The material feels a bit cheap, and it doesn't breathe well, so I ended up sweating a lot. \n\nAlso, I expected it to keep me dry, but I got a little wet during a light rain. Definitely not as water-resistant as I hoped. The pockets are",

The material feels kind of flimsy, and I didn\u2019t feel very protected from the wind like I thought I would. The sizing is off too; it was way too tight in the shoulders but loose elsewhere, so I had to return it. I also wasn't impressed with the water resistance\u2014got caught in a light drizzle and ended up wet. For the price, I expected something better, but it",

The fit is strange\u2014really tight in some areas and loose in others. I thought it'd be good for both weather and style, but it ends up feeling clunky. The pockets are basically useless; too shallow. I expected more, especially after the reviews I saw. Not worth the price in my opinion. Disappointed.",

A qualidade do material parece um pouco barata e n\u00e3o senti que protege bem do vento ou da chuva. O ajuste tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 dos melhores, parece meio solto em algumas partes e desconfort\u00e1vel em outras. A cor \u00e9 bonita, mas isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 o suficiente para compensar os outros problemas. Comprei pensando que seria uma boa escolha para o dia a dia, mas acabei decepcionado. N\u00e3o",
