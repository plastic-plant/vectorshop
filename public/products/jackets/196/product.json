            "review": "I was excited to try this jacket out since I needed something for unpredictable weather. It definitely has some great features, like being lightweight and the pocket space is decent. The water resistance works well, and I stayed dry during a light rain. However, I found it lacking in warmth. I just expected it to keep me a bit cozier when the temperature drops. The fit is also a little off; it feels tight around the shoulders when I move my arms, so that\u2019s annoying.\n\nOverall,",

            "review": "I recently bought this jacket and while it\u2019s not terrible, it's definitely not what I expected. It feels a bit lighter than I wanted, making it hard to trust it during really tough weather. The pockets are useful, but they could be deeper. On the plus side, it kind of looks nice, and I like the color options. It fits okay, not too big or too tight, which is nice. I just wish it was a bit warmer for chillier days. Overall, it\u2019s",

The fit is decent, not too tight or loose, but it doesn\u2019t do a fantastic job in the rain. I was caught in a light shower, and I could feel some moisture seeping through after a while. Honestly, I expected better waterproofing for the price. The pockets are a bit small too\u2014could use more room for my phone",
