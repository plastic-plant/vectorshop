Les couleurs sont vraiment vibrantes et ajoutent une belle touche \u00e0 ma maison. L'installation \u00e9tait simple, et j'appr\u00e9cie de pouvoir changer le design selon mon humeur ou la saison. Cependant, j'aurais aim\u00e9 avoir un peu plus de choix dans les styles artistiques disponibles. La qualit\u00e9 de l'image peut parfois varier l\u00e9g\u00e8rement, mais c'est un petit d\u00e9tail par rapport \u00e0 l'effet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que \u00e7a apporte.",
