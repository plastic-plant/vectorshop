I expected a nice piece for my wall, but instead got something that looks like it was made in a hurry. Tried to get in touch with support, but they were no help at all. Just don't waste your time or cash on this.",

            "review": "Honestly, I was really disappointed. The colors look totally off like the photo was just photoshopped. The canvas is flimsy and not stretched right \u2013 kinda uneven around the edges. I hang it up and it looks more like a cheap print than art. Also, the smell!? It was strong like some kind of chemicals and it took days to air out. Definitely not what I was expecting. Save your money for some decent art.",
