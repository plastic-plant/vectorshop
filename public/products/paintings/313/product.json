I expected something much better, definetly not worth the price. super disappointing!",

The paint is all smudged and really terrible quality. I hung it up, and it looks like a kid made it in art class. Honestly, I could\u2019ve done better myself. Super disappointed, waste of money. Just don\u2019t bother!",

The quality is super cheap, looks like something from a discount store. I tried to hang it up and it fell apart\u2014like, does it even come with good backing? I got so frustrated! Save your money and don\u2019t buy this garbage. I can\u2019t believe people say it\u2019s good. Total letdown.",

Hung it up and just feels sad to look at. I could\u2019ve gone to a thrift shop and found better stuff. Really disappointed, I wanted something lovely for my living room but this is just ugly.
