Tried to hang one up and it just fell apart. Also, the sizes are not accurate at all. Thought I'd get something nice for my living room but its just trash. Total waste of money, don\u2019t recommend it at all. Save your cash and look elsewhere.",

The colors are way off from what I saw online. Tried to hang one up, and it just fell down because the material is so flimsy. Plus, the frames don\u2019t even match! Seriously disappointed, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. Save your money.",

I expected sooo much more but this is just not worth it. I wouldn\u2019t bother with this. 1 star is too generous.",
