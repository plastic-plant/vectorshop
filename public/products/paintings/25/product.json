The variety of brush styles is great, which makes it pretty fun to play around with different techniques. However, I found that the interface can be a bit confusing, especially for a beginner. Sometimes the colors don't come out as vibrant as you\u2019d like, and it takes a while to get used to how everything works. It crashes occasionally too, which is frustrating when you\u2019re in the middle of something creative.",

It\u2019s got some really neat features, and the colors are bright and vibrant, which is great, but at times it feels like it\u2019s missing something. The brush effects can be nice for grassy textures, but they can also be a little wonky if you\u2019re not careful. I run into some glitches now and then, making it frustrating. Also, the learning curve was steeper than I",

The interface is pretty user-friendly, which is great, but sometimes the brush strokes just don\u2019t feel right. I don't know if it\u2019s supposed to imitate real paint or what, but I didn\u2019t get the depth I wanted in my artwork. \n\nI had a bit of fun experimenting with different styles, but there were moments where it felt like I was just fighting with the controls.

The variety of brushes is nice, and the textures can be interesting, but I found the overall experience a bit underwhelming. The interface feels cluttered sometimes, making it hard to focus on my designs. Also, the response time can lag, which is frustrating when you're in the flow of creating. I can see some potential for good pieces, but it doesn't fully deliver on the promise. Not bad,",

The variety of brush styles is nice, but they don't always produce the results I was hoping for. Some of the colors feel off once applied to the canvas, which is frustrating because I had a vision in mind. I also noticed that the responsiveness can lag, especially when working on larger projects. I appreciate the creative freedom it offers",
