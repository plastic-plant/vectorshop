Not what I expected for the price at all. Tried to return it, but the customer service was terrible too. Just a total waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

Not inspiring at all. Tried to hang it in my living room, but had to take it down after a few days. Just doesn't fit anywhere in my house. Wish I'd saved my money. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.",
