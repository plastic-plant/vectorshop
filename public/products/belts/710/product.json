The material feels okay, but it seems not as sturdy as I hoped. After a few weeks, I noticed some wear and tear, which is a bit disappointing.\n\nThe size options were fine, and it fit well at first, but it doesn\u2019t adjust too easily. I\u2019ve struggled a little with the buckle; sometimes",

The buckle does its job most of the time, but sometimes it gets stuck or doesn\u2019t click in properly. I can see why it gets mixed reviews. It's comfy for casual wear, but I wouldn\u2019t wanna wear it out for an all-day event. For the price, I expected a bit more",

The design is nice, and it goes well with most of my outfits, but I've noticed some wear and tear after just a few weeks. The buckle can be a bit tricky to handle sometimes too, which is frustrating. It\u2019s comfortable enough but I find myself adjusting it throughout the day, which isn\u2019t ideal. Overall, it\u2019s okay for the price, but I maybe expected",

The design looks sleek and the color options are decent, but it felt a bit awkward when I was wearing it. It keeps slipping a little, and I have to adjust it more often than I'd like. The material seems alright, but it doesn\u2019t have that premium feel. I think it looks good enough for casual outings, but I wouldn't rely on it for more formal occasions.",

I ordered my usual size, but it feels a little tight, which was disappointing. I also wish the material was a bit more flexible; it can feel stiff at first, and that\u2019s not super comfy. Plus, the buckle is okay but feels slightly bulky. Overall, it\u2019s not a bad product,",
