The design is nice and it feels durable, but it\u2019s not really as comfortable as I expected. Sometimes it digs into my side, especially when I sit down. Adjusting it can be a bit of a hassle too \u2013 you have to really tug on it, and if you overdo it, it gets too loose. The color options are pretty good, which I liked, but overall it just doesn't",

It looks nice and the material seems decent, but the fit is a bit weird. Sometimes it rides up, and that\u2019s kind of annoying. Adjusting it isn't always smooth either; I often find myself fiddling with it. I mean, it works for the most part, but I've definitely had better belts before.",

The material feels a bit stiff at times, especially when I sit down. Also, adjusting it can be a bit tricky\u2014like, I wish there was an easier way to find the right size. I\u2019ve had better ones for sure. It gets the job done but doesn\u2019t really impress. Gave it 3 stars because it's not horrible, but",

            "review": "So, the belt's okay. It does its job of holding my pants up, but it's not anything special. The material feels a bit cheap, almost like it'll start fraying soon. The buckle is slightly stiff, and I wish it adjusted better to different sizes. I like the color options, but it doesn't seem very durable. It's decent for the price, but I expected a bit more for the hassle of choosing it. Guess it\u2019s an average belt\u2014can't really complain too much, but",

The material feels decent, but I was expecting something a bit sturdier given the price. Sometimes it slips a little, which is annoying, especially when I\u2019m rushing. The buckle is kinda clunky but does the job. Overall, it\u2019s not bad, but I probably wouldn\u2019t buy it again.",
