On one hand, it's flexible and adjusts to your size, which is nice. Sometimes I appreciate that it doesn\u2019t dig into my waist like some others do. \n\nHowever, the material feels cheaper than expected and I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019ll really last.

On one hand, it looks stylish and has cool adjustable features, so I can fit it pretty well for different sizes and outfits I guess.
