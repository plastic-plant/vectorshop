I ordered my usual size, but it feels tighter than I expected. I like the adjustable feature, but honestly, it just wasn\u2019t as easy to use as I thought. The material seems decent, but I worry about how it\u2019ll hold up over time. Overall, it does the job, but",

The design is nice and the colors are cool, but it doesn't really hold up as well as I'd hoped. The buckle can be a bit fiddly to use, and sometimes it feels like it might loosen during the day. Comfort-wise, it\u2019s decent, but I expected more for the price. You also can\u2019t adjust it much unless you want to cut it down, which is a bummer",

The material feels decent, not super high quality, but alright for the price. However, I found the sizing a bit odd\u2014It didn't fit me quite right even though I measured myself before ordering. Another thing I noticed is that the buckle can be a little tricky to operate sometimes, especially when I\u2019m in a hurry. Once it\u2019s on, it does hold",

I bought it for everyday use, and it does hold up my pants, so that's good. \n\nThe adjustability is nice but sometimes it slips, which can be annoying, especially when I'm out and about. I also wish there were more color options. Overall, it's serviceable, but I expected a bit more for the price.",
