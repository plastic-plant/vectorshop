I don't even want to wear it, just sits in the closet. waste of money, really. wouldn't recommend to anyone.",

The material is super cheap and feels like it'll break any time. The buckle is hard to use too - I have to struggle every time. Save your money and get something better. This was a total waste.",

I\u2019d give it zero stars if I could.",

The material is stiff and uncomfortable. It won't fit properly no matter how hard I try. Total waste of money. Would not recommend to anyone. Save your cash.",
