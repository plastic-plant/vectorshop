The design is modern and stylish, which matches almost anything in my wardrobe. The material feels sturdy, so I think it will last a while. \n\nOne downside is that sometimes the buckle gets a little tricky to open, especially when I'm in a rush.

The design is nice and modern, which I appreciate. I particularly love the range of customization options\u2014it's great having the ability to switch styles according to my outfit or mood. However, I did expect a bit more from the virtual experience itself. Sometimes it feels a bit laggy when I'm trying to interact with it, which can be a little annoying",
