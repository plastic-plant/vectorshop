After just a few uses, it's already got deep cuts and scratches all over it, looking real mess. The surface doesn't even stay level. I tried chopping some veggies, and they kept slipping around like crazy, so annoying! Plus, it stains really bad\u2014I can't get that stuff out no matter how much I scrub. I regret buying this, not worth",

No grip on the counter so it just slid around. And the stains won't come out, even after washing it right away. Save your money and buy something else! Total waste.",

I thought the material would hold up, but it's flimsy and cheap feeling. Can't even chop veggies without it slipping around on the counter. Super annoying! Plus, it stains so easily, like, why even pretend to be a fancy board? I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Save your money and get something better!",

It bruises and scratches super easy. Clean up is a pain too, the stains just don\u2019t come off. It\u2019s too thin and feels flimsy overall. I\u2019ve had better beat-up wooden boards. Save your money and get something else, this is a total flop.",

First time I tried to chop garlic, it looked like I was carving into wood. Super disappointing. Plus, it slips all over the counter, very unsafe. I feel like my knives are duller already from using it. It\u2019s all hype no substance. Save your money, this is just junk. I don\u2019t get how anyone thinks this is good. Terrible experience all around",
