The surface is nice and smooth, so chopping veggies isn\u2019t a problem, but I\u2019ve found the material doesn\u2019t grip the counter as well as I\u2019d hoped. It slips a little when I\u2019m using my knife, which can be a bit annoying. The size is good, not too heavy to move around but still large enough for most tasks.\n\nCleaning\u2019s easy enough too. Just a quick wash,",

The size is decent, and it fits well on my counter, but it scratches pretty easily. The material feels a bit cheap, and I\u2019m concerned about it holding up long-term. It cleans fine, but it doesn\u2019t really have a non-slip grip, so sometimes it slips around when I'm chopping, which can be a bit frustrating. It gets",

I expected it to be more durable since it came highly recommended, but I\u2019ve already noticed a few scratches and gouges after only a couple of uses. \n\nIt\u2019s also a bit on the slippery side. I have to really be careful when chopping veggies, which can be frustrating. Some food gets stuck",
