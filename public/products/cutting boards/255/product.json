            "review": "This cutting board is a total joke. It warped after just one use. Couldn't even cut veggies straight without slipping everywhere. The material feels cheap like it's gonna break any second. Also, not easy to clean; stuff gets stuck in the grooves and it\u2019s hard to scrub out. I regret buying it. Definitely not worth the money. Will be looking for a better one.",

            "review": "I was really disappointed with this cutting board. It's super flimsy and moves around too much when I'm slicing. The surface started to scratch after just a few uses, like, really bad. Also, it claimed to be \u201ceasy to clean\u201d but I had to scrub it so hard to get the stains off. Total waste of money. Would not recommend. Save your cash and look for something better.",

Not worth the money at all. Plus it kept slipping all over the counter! I\u2019m done using it, just sticks to my old board which is way better. Total waste of time and cash. 1 star for sure.",

            "review": "Very disappointed with this cutting board. The material feels cheap and it keeps sliding around on the counter. Tried to chop some veggies, and it was like trying to cut on ice. Not happy at all! Also, the grooves for the juice are way too shallow, so now there's a mess everywhere when I cut. Honestly, it just makes cooking more of a hassle. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Can't believe I wasted my money.",
