It does tend to get a few scratches after some use, which isn\u2019t ideal. The size is good for most tasks, but it feels a bit bulky for my smaller kitchen. Cleanup is okay, but I\u2019ve noticed it stains after cutting certain fruits, which is kind of disappointing. Overall, it\u2019s decent but not amazing. Could",

It\u2019s decent for everyday slicing and dicing, but I noticed some deep grooves after just a few uses. Cleaning it isn\u2019t the simplest either; food tends to get stuck in those grooves. \n\nI do like that it's lightweight, which makes it easy to move around in the kitchen, but I can't help but feel like it could be more",

The size is decent, but I've noticed it scratches pretty easily, which is a bit annoying. Also, it can be slippery when I'm chopping, so I have to be extra careful. It\u2019s lightweight, which is good for moving around, but it does feel slightly flimsy. I wish it had a non-slip bottom or something to help",
