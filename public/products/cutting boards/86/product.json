            "review": "I was really looking forward to this cutting board, but it didn't live up to my expectations. First off, it's way too thin, so it feels flimsy when chopping. I\u2019ve already noticed scratches after just a few uses. It doesn\u2019t have a non-slip backing, which makes it slide around a lot on my countertop, especially when using a sharp knife. Plus, the surface isn\u2019t great for keeping juices from vegetables contained, so I ended up with a mess every time. It looks okay",

The surface feels a bit flimsy, and I noticed scratches after only a few uses. It also gets slippery sometimes, especially when chopping wet ingredients, which makes me feel a bit unsafe. Clean-up is okay, but I expected it to be easier. It looks nice at least, but performance could definitely be better. It\u2019s not a total fail, but I won\u2019t be reaching for it when",

It's also hard to grip properly when I'm chopping. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I expected better. The colors and design are nice, but unfortunately, it's not functional enough for me. A bit disappointing overall. Would not recommend if you're after something durable.",

Chopping veggies can be a struggle, and I noticed some knife marks on it right away. Also, it's super heavy which makes it a pain to move around. It just takes up so much space. I wanted something easier to clean, but the food bits get stuck in the cracks. I thought it would be a good addition to my kitchen, but I'm not really",

Knives seem to dull faster on it, and it doesn't hold steady on the counter; it slides around too much. Cleaning is a hassle too, since grooves seem to trap food bits. I really wanted to love it, but I think I'll be looking for a different option. Might work for some people, but",
