The surface is too soft and started to scratch really easily even with just normal chopping. One of the edges splintered after a few uses, which is frustrating. I expected it to hold up better.

The design is pretty but the surface just scratches way too easily. I expected it to be more durable for the price.

It looks nice on the counter, but when I actually used it, it didn't hold up well at all. The surface scratches easily, and I've noticed some stains that just won't come out. I thought it would be knife-friendly, but my knives take a beating on it, and some cuts feel like they\u2019re dulling faster than usual. \n\nIt's also heavier than I expected,",
