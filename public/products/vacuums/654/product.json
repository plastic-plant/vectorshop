Also, it doesn\u2019t pick up my cat hair as well as I expected. I have to go over the same spot multiple times, which is so frustrating. The cord is short too; I feel like I\u2019m always running out of reach and have to plug it back in. Maybe it works better on hard",

            "review": "I really wanted to like this vacuum. It has some good suction power at first, but after a few uses, it started to lose its effectiveness. The design seemed cool, but it gets stuck on rugs and has trouble picking up larger debris, which is frustrating. The cord isn't very long either, and I find myself constantly needing to switch outlets. I guess it's okay for quick clean-ups, but I expected more for the price. Overall, not the best investment; I've had better for less.",

It also feels kind of cheap, like parts are going to break anytime. The design is okay, but it\u2019s heavy and hard to maneuver around the house. I was expecting much better for the price. At least it kind of gets the job done, but I won\u2019t be recommending it to anyone. Disappointing",

I find myself going over the same spot multiple times. The design is bulky and kinda hard to maneuver around furniture. Also, the dust container fills up too quickly, and it isn\u2019t that easy to empty without making a mess. I expected way more for the price. If you're looking for something reliable, you might want to look elsewhere.",

A few pet hairs and crumbs get left behind all the time. The suction isn\u2019t as strong as I hoped, especially for carpets. \n\nI also found it heavy to maneuver around the house, which doesn't make cleaning any easier. It gets hot after a while, too. The design is nice, but who cares if it",
