It picks up dirt and debris well most of the time, but I sometimes find it misses spots, especially in corners. Battery life is decent, but I wish it lasted longer since I'm usually going back and forth plugging it in. It\u2019s lightweight and easy to maneuver, which I like, but the dustbin fills up quickly, and emptying it can get messy. The noise level isn\u2019t bad",

On one hand, it does pick up dust and dirt pretty well on hardwood floors, and it\u2019s not too heavy, which is nice. But on the flip side, it gets stuck on rugs and I've had to rescue it a few times. The battery life isn't the best either. I can get through one room before needing to recharge. \n\nIt also has this weird noise sometimes that",
