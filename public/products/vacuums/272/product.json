            "review": "Pros: It's got decent suction power for everyday messes and the blade-less design means it's quieter than my old vacuum. I like that it's lightweight; moving it around isn\u2019t a hassle. The filtration system does catch a good bit of dust and pet hair, so that\u2019s a plus for allergy sufferers.\n\nOn the downside, I've found that the battery life isn't great if you're cleaning a bigger area; it drains pretty quickly. Also, it tends to get clogged a bit if there\u2019s larger debris,",

First off, it\u2019s super lightweight, which is nice for carrying around the house, but I feel like it could do better on carpet. It doesn\u2019t pick up pet hair as well as I had hoped, especially on my living room rug. The noise level is okay; not super quiet but not super loud either. \n\nBattery life seems decent, I could vacuum",
