The design looks sleek but feels cheap. I deal with some pet hair, and it struggles a lot. \n\nPixelated sensor is more trouble than it\u2019s worth\u2014constantly getting stuck on furniture.

The suction power isn\u2019t what they advertised, I had to go over the same spot multiple times to pick up crumbs. Not very user-friendly either. The app is a bit clunky, and lost connection more than once. Also, I thought it would be",

De batterij gaat ook veel te snel leeg, dus ik moet hem na elke kamer al opladen. Het meeste lukt alleen als je steeds langs dezelfde plek gaat, wat een gedoe is.\n\nOk\u00e9, het design is wel leuk en hij is lichtgewicht, maar daar bespaar",
