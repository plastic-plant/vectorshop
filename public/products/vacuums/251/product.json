            "review": "This vacuum is a total letdown. Does not pick up dirt or hair. Just pushes stuff around. I spent way too much $$ for this junk. It gets stuck on the carpet and I have to keep resetting it. Battery dies super fast, never gets the whole room. So loud for something that doesn\u2019t even work right. The app is useless too. Seriously, don't waste your money, I wish I did more research before buying. Not worth one star at all. I just wanted something",

The battery life is a joke too. Half an hour and it dies, even if I\u2019m just doing one room. Cleaning the filters is a pain, and I swear they just clog up right away. The design looked cool but honestly it\u2019s just a fancy paperweight now. Do yourself a favor and skip",
