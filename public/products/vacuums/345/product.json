It cleans decently, but it doesn\u2019t always pick up bigger debris, like pet hair or cereal. The battery life could also be better. It\u2019s nice that it can go anywhere, but it often runs out of juice halfway through the cleaning.

Sometimes it gets confused and ends up stuck in the same corner for a while, like it can't figure out what to do next. The battery life is okay but not great; it needs to be charged after just a regular clean-up. Plus, it doesn't handle pet hair as well as I expected. Might be good for light use or small spaces,",
