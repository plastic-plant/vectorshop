            "review": "I really regret buying this vacuum. I expected it to actually work, but it just doesn\u2019t suck up much at all. I had to go over the same spot like 10 times, and it still left dirt behind. It keeps getting stuck on everything, like the carpet fringe and even small toys. The cord is way too short too. I'm always tripping over it. It feels cheap and flimsy. I thought it was gonna be great from the ads, but seriously, what a joke",

            "review": "This vacuum is a total waste of money. I\u2019ve used it like, 3 times and it barely picks up anything. I spent more time going over the same spot than actually cleaning. Super loud too, like really annoying. The cord is way too short and gets tangled up sooo easily. Also, it falls over every time I try to move it. Just makes cleaning way harder than it should be. Can\u2019t recommend this at all. Seriously disappointed.",

De plus, il fait un bruit terrible comme un camion. Le fil est trop court, je dois changer de prise tout le temps. j'esp\u00e9rais mieux mais c'est un gros flop. N'achetez pas, c'est de l'argent gaspill\u00e9.",

The hose is super short and the canister fills up way too fast. The worst part is the noise! It sounds like a dying animal. I\u2019ll take my old vacuum any day. Not worth the money at all. Total waste!",
