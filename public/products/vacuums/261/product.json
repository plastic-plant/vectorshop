It struggles with pet hair on my carpet, and the battery life is way too short. I have to charge it constantly, and even then, it feels like I\u2019m not getting a deep clean. The controls are also complicated and not intuitive at all. It\u2019s kind of big and bulky too, which makes it hard to store. I wanted",

I found myself going over spots multiple times just to pick up dust and crumbs. The battery life is also shorter than I expected, and I was super frustrated when it died in the middle of cleaning. \n\nThe attachments are kind of a hassle to switch out, and sometimes it feels like they're just in the way",

La puissance d'aspiration n'est pas terrible, et il a du mal \u00e0 attraper m\u00eame la poussi\u00e8re sur les tapis. Parfois, il fait un bruit bizarre, comme s'il se d\u00e9battait avec quelque chose. \n\nEn plus, je trouve que c'est assez lourd \u00e0 manipuler, ce qui rend le nettoyage plus difficile que pr\u00e9vu.

A pot\u00eancia de suc\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 bem vari\u00e1vel \u2014 \u00e0s vezes funciona super bem, mas em outras parece que n\u00e3o consegue nem tirar a sujeira do tapete. Outro ponto negativo \u00e9 que \u00e9 bem barulhento, m\u00e1s eu j\u00e1 esperava um pouquinho de barulho, por\u00e9m isso me incomoda durante o uso.
