As al\u00e7as s\u00e3o bem desconfort\u00e1veis, da at\u00e9 dor se carregar muito peso. E a parte de baixo nem tem prote\u00e7\u00e3o, parece que vai rasgar f\u00e1cil. Achava que o espa\u00e7o interno era maior, mas pra mim n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente; acaba ficando tudo amontoado. O design at\u00e9 \u00e9 bonito, mas",

It feels flimsy and I worry it won't hold up under all my laundry. The handle is awkward to grip and kind of digs into your hand when it\u2019s full.

The handles are not sturdy enough, and it tips over way too easily when you\u2019re carrying it anywhere. It looks pretty in the corner of my room, but functionally it doesn't hold up.
