            "review": "This laundry caddy is a total miss. I bought it hoping it would make sorting easier but it\u2019s just a pain. The material feels cheap, like it might fall apart any second. Plus, it doesn\u2019t hold much at all. I can barely fit a week\u2019s worth of clothes in there. The compartments are really small too, so I can't sort properly. Perhaps worst of all, it tips over all the time if you don\u2019t watch it closely. I kept tripping over it.",

It\u2019s way too small for my laundry, I can't fit even half of it. The wheels don\u2019t match up right, it always tips over. Seriously, I just wasted my money on this thing. Just go get a normal basket, this one\u2019s not worth it at all.",
