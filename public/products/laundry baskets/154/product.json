The materials feel cheap and flimsy, like it could break any second. I tried carrying it up the stairs and the handles started tearing right away. It\u2019s a struggle to even get things in and out without spilling everywhere. Honestly, don\u2019t waste your money on this. There are way better options out there! Instead of being helpful",

It\u2019s way too flimsy\u2014I thought the whole point was to hold clothes, but it feels like I might break it every time I pick it up. Handles are super weak and started to tear after just a couple of uses. Would NOT recommend if you have more than a few pieces of laundry. Just a waste of money. Can't even hold my regular weekly load without feeling like it's gonna fall apart. Super disappointed!",
