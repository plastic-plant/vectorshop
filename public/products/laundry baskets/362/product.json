On one hand, the design is pretty cool and it does fold away easily, which is helpful for saving space. But on the other hand, it feels a bit flimsy when it\u2019s fully loaded with clothes. I worry that it\u2019s not going to hold up over time. \n\nAlso, the size is okay but it\u2019s kinda small for a family; we end up needing another basket,",

On one hand, I love that it folds down flat for easy storage, which is great for my small laundry room. It makes it really easy to tuck it away when it\u2019s not in use. However, I've found it doesn't hold as much as I thought it would does. When I fill it up, the sides start to sag a bit, and I worry about it",

            "review": "I've been using this laundry basket for a few weeks now. It's nice that it can fold up, which is great for saving space. However, I wish it were a bit sturdier. Sometimes, when I put more clothes in it, the sides feel like they might collapse, and I worry about it not holding up long term. The color selection is decent, but I wouldn't say it's anything special. It does the job, but it kind of struggles with larger loads. Not the worst option out",
