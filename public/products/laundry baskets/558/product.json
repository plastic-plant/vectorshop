The handles are awkward and hurt my hands when I'm carrying it. Also, it toppled over way too easily; I've had a few near-misses with spilling clothes everywhere. Plus, the design is kinda dull and not very stylish. I wish I could say I loved it, but honestly, I\u2019ve found better options before",

But in reality, it\u2019s not spacious enough for a family\u2019s laundry. The handles are awkward and hard to grip when it\u2019s full, and I had to bend down to shove my clothes in. \n\nAlso, the materials seem flimsy. After a week, I noticed a couple of small tears on the side. I thought it",

Wenn ich sie voll mit W\u00e4sche mache, muss ich echt aufpassen, dass sie nicht umf\u00e4llt. Au\u00dferdem ist der Griff nicht so bequem. Wenn die Box schwer ist, tut mir die Hand weh, weil der Griff zu schmal ist. Die Farbe finde ich sch\u00f6n, aber die Funktionalit\u00e4t ist nicht",
