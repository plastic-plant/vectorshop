The handles are kind of uncomfortable to hold when it\u2019s full, and the material seems weaker than expected. I\u2019ve had it for a couple of months, and it\u2019s already showing some wear. It holds laundry, but that\u2019s about it. Not very impressed, honestly. Might look for something better next time.",

Apr\u00e8s quelques utilisations, j'ai remarqu\u00e9 des grattages sur le fond et il n'est pas si l\u00e9ger non plus. Je voulais un panier facile \u00e0 transporter, mais celui-ci est plus difficile \u00e0 soulever que ce \u00e0 quoi je m'attendais. En plus, la poign\u00e9e est mal plac\u00e9e, ce qui rend le transport encore",

            "review": "I recently got this laundry basket, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. It's decent-looking but doesn't really fit much. The size is just off - I was expecting more room for my laundry. Also, the material feels kinda flimsy, like it could rip any second. Another thing is that the handles are uncomfortable; they dig into my hands when I carry it. I thought it would be more practical, but it doesn't really do the job well. Overall, not thrilled with it",

The weave starts to come apart after only a few weeks, and it's not big enough to hold a whole week's worth of laundry. I feel like I\u2019m always having to empty it and do multiple trips. The handles aren't the best either \u2013 they hurt my hands when it\u2019s full. Honestly, I expected more for the price. It's alright, but won't be my",
