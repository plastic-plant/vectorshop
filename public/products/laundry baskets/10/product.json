The handles are awkward and it\u2019s hard to carry even when it\u2019s not full. I expected it to hold a decent amount, but it barely fits a few days\u2019 worth of clothes. Also, the material feels kinda cheap, like it might tear apart anytime. I can see why others gave it low stars. Not sure if I would recommend",

After just a couple weeks, one of the handles started to fray, and now I have to be careful when I lift it. It holds a decent amount of clothes, but I\u2019ve had issues with it tipping over when I pull it to the washer. Plus, the color choices are kinda dull - I expected something a bit nicer. Honestly",

The fabric started to fray after just a few uses, and I\u2019m worried it won't hold up for long. I thought the compartments were a good idea, but they don\u2019t really fit much at all. I found myself constantly rearranging clothes just to make it work. Plus, it\u2019s heavier than I expected. Carry",
