Not big enough too, maybe my clothes are too much for it but I can hardly fit a weeks worth in here. The handles are super weak, can\u2019t carry it without it digging into my hands. Every time I try to lift it, the whole thing tips over. Completely useless. Would give it zero stars if I could. Stay away",

            "review": "Werkt helemaal niet zoals beloofd. De mand is veel te klein en past bijna geen kleren in. Materiaal voelt goedkoop aan en gaat helemaal geen jaar mee. De naden beginnen al te lossen namaar paar weken gebruik. Geen grip op de bodem dus met een beetje was uren ergens anders. Ik vond het echt zonde van mijn geld. Echt niet te gebruiken, wat een teleurstelling. Geen aanrader!",

The handles feel like they\u2019ll snap off any second. And good luck keeping it clean; the fabric attracts lint like a magnet. I\u2019ve had way better baskets for half the price. Total waste of money. I don't even wanna use it anymore. My clothes just end up piling on the floor. Really disappointed with this thing!",

The handles broke after only a few uses, which is ridiculous. The material feels cheap and flimsy, and I can already see ripples after a couple of weeks. Doesn\u2019t even roll properly, it just gets stuck everywhere. Can\u2019t believe I wasted my money on this thing. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone.",
