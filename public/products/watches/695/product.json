The design is sleek, and it looks pretty good on my wrist, but functionality is a bit hit or miss. The battery life is decent, lasts about a day and a half, which is okay for me but I was expecting more. \n\nNotifications are nice to have but sometimes they lag and it gets annoying. The fitness tracking feature works most of the time but doesn\u2019t always accurately",

The design is sleek and modern, which is nice, but the battery life leaves a lot to be desired\u2014it barely lasts a day. The notifications work pretty well, though some of them arrive late, which is frustrating if you rely on them. Fitness tracking seems accurate, but I wish there were more features for tracking different activities. Honestly, it feels like it has potential",

Die Synchronisation mit dem Smartphone dauert oft l\u00e4nger als erwartet, und die App k\u00f6nnte sicherer und intuitiver sein. Die Akku-Lebensdauer ist okay, aber nicht der Hit \u2013 ich lade sie \u00f6fter als gedacht auf.\n\nDie Wetteranzeige war eine coole Idee, aber nicht immer genau. Auch die Auswahl an Zifferbl\u00e4ttern",
