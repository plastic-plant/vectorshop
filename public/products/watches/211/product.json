The display is so hard to read and I had issues syncing it with my phone. One moment it says I\u2019m at 500 steps, then it\u2019ll say 5000\u2014all over the place! Battery dies way too quick even when not using it. Look elsewhere, save your money. Form over function, big miss here.",

The design looks nice but it's just for show. I can't rely on it at all. Also, the app is super confusing and not user-friendly. Really regretting this purchase... save your money and look elsewhere.",

The battery life is terrible, like it runs out within days. The design looked nice online, but feels cheap in person. The bands are uncomfortable and they dug into my wrist. I thought I could rely on this for everyday use, but I can\u2019t even trust it to keep time properly. I really wish I hadn\u2019t wasted my money on this",
