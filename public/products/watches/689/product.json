The battery died on me after just a week. Tried to reset it but it\u2019s just stuck now. Not user-friendly at all. The app doesn't connect properly, which is frustrating. I really wanted to love it but ended up super disappointed. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Total waste of money.",

I can\u2019t even see the time half the time, super frustrating. The app is terrible too. Just really let down and it\u2019s not worth the money at all. Will be looking for a proper watch instead.",

Can\u2019t even read the time most days cuz the screen glitches. Set up was a nightmare too, instructions made no sense, and I ended up frustrated. Waste of money for sure. I wouldn't recommend it at all. Just stick to real watches.",

It looks cheap too, definitely not stylish. I thought I\u2019d get more for the price I paid but it's def not worth it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone. Total waste of money.",
