I find myself having to charge it way more often than any other smartwatch I've owned. The interface can be confusing too\u2014it's not very user-friendly at all.

The color on the screen isn\u2019t that clear, making it hard to read in bright light. I was hoping I could get some fitness tracking done, but it\u2019s been pretty inaccurate. I mean, come on?",
