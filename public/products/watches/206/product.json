Setting the time properly was a bit confusing at first, and the instructions weren\u2019t very clear. The fitness tracking works okay, though I've noticed it can be a little off sometimes. Battery life is decent, but it doesn\u2019t last as long as I hoped, needing charges more often than I\u2019d like",

The features like reminders and activity tracking are neat, but I wish they worked better. Sometimes it feels a bit slow to respond, and I've noticed a couple of times where it just glitches. Also, the battery life isn't as great as I expected. I find myself charging it more often than I'd like. It's a decent watch for",

It's cool that it tracks time and a few other things, but honestly it doesn\u2019t do much beyond that. Sometimes it lags when syncing with my phone, which can be annoying. \n\nBattery life is decent, but I expected a bit more longevity, especially since it's supposed to manage all these tasks. I really wanted to love",

The design is nice and feels decent, but on the other hand, it doesn't keep time as accurately as I hoped. Sometimes it will lag a bit or just stop working for a few moments. Battery life might be okay, but definitely not what I expected. \n\nFor the price, I wish it could",
