I miss calls and can't even check the time properly. The battery life is a joke, dies after a few hours, and that\u2019s if I'm lucky. The tracking doesn\u2019t work at all, so it\u2019s pretty much useless for fitness too. Honestly, I can't believe I wasted money on this. Would not recommend it to anyone. Just stick",

The battery died in like less than a week. It\u2019s not comfortable to wear either, really heavy and keeps slipping off. The app is confusing and crashes all the time. I regret buying this piece of trash. Do yourself a favor and skip it. Zero stars if I could.",

Perdi horas tentando configurar e ainda n\u00e3o consegui. As notifica\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o funcionam e a bateria dura menos do que prometido. Olho pro meu pulso e sinto que joguei dinheiro fora. Totalmente sem utilidade e n\u00e3o vale a pena. N\u00e3o recomendo de jeito nenhum!",
