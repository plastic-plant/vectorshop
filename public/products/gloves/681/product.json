O material \u00e9 confort\u00e1vel, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o aderentes como eu esperava. Tinha esperan\u00e7a que fossem pr\u00e1ticas para tarefas do dia a dia, mas \u00e0s vezes sinto que escorrego objetos com elas. A rugosidade da palma \u00e9 legal, mas talvez pudesse ser um pouco mais firme. Al\u00e9m disso, elas esquenta bastante as m\u00e3os, o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 bom em dias quentes. Para uso leve",

The grip is decent for everyday tasks, but I\u2019ve found that they slip a bit when wet, which can be annoying. The fit is pretty snug, which I like, but after a few hours wearing them, they start to get uncomfortable. I expected more durability too; there are already some frayed edges after a month of use. They\u2019re not bad for light chores, but I wouldn\u2019t rely",

The grip is decent, but they don\u2019t fit as snugly as I\u2019d like, which makes it a bit tricky for finer tasks. They do keep your hands dry, but my palms get kind of sweaty after wearing them for a while. I also noticed a little wear and tear on the fingers already, which is disappointing. Overall, not bad for light",

However, I found them a bit bulky for doing quick jobs like cleaning or sorting things. They also seem to get pretty hot and sweaty after wearing them for a while. I expected better flexibility and comfort honestly. They look decent and the stitching seems fine, but they're not the best fit for me. Overall, they're okay for the price, but I\u2019m not sure I",
