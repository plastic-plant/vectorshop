The grip isn\u2019t that great\u2014it slips more than I\u2019d like when I\u2019m handling wet items. They are comfortable enough but I expected a bit more durability. After just a few uses, one of the seams started coming apart. They look good, but looks aren\u2019t everything, right?

They feel bulky and make it hard to grip smaller objects, which is frustrating when you\u2019re just trying to do simple tasks around the house. The material is okay, but I expected better for the price. They also started to wear down pretty quickly, and I noticed some seams coming loose after just a couple of uses. I guess they do provide some grip,",

The grip is okay, but after using them for a few hours, they start to feel really loose and irritated my skin. The material seems kinda cheap too\u2014my friend even had a hole appear after just a few uses! \n\nThey're not insulated enough for cold weather, which is disappointing since I wanted to use them outside. Overall, they get the job done, but I wouldn\u2019t",
