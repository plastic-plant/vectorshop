I definitely do not recommend.",

It's like they don\u2019t even fit right. Waste of money sad to say. Can\u2019t believe people are saying good things. I would NOT recommend these at all. Not worth your time or cash!",

Ils glissent tout le temps, je peux m\u00eame pas porter un plat sans risquer de le faire tomber. En plus, ils sont tr\u00e8s mal ajust\u00e9s, ma main se sent super \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9troit. Sentiment cheap quand je les mets. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 un trou dans l'un d'eux apr\u00e8s juste une semaine d'utilisation. Je regrette vraiment cet achat.",

Plus, they feel so cheap. I wore them for a bit and they started to tear. The fit is all weird too, super tight in some spots and loose in others. I don't understand the hype, bc for me, they are just useless. Would not recommend. Save your money.",
