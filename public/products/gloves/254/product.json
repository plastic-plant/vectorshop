Anytime I\u2019m handling something slippery, I feel like I'm gonna drop it. Also, they got a little sweaty after long use, so be prepared for that. \n\nFor light tasks around the house, they do the job fine. Just don\u2019t expect anything too advanced. The durability seems okay, but I wonder how long they'll",

The grip is okay, and I can manage to handle most tools without dropping them. However, after just a few uses, I noticed they started to tear a little at the seams, which makes me question their durability. The fit is also a bit too tight for my liking, even though I ordered the right size. They could be more comfortable for longer wear. Overall, they're",

The grip is decent, but I expected more slip resistance, especially for handling wet items. I also noticed they started to wear out a bit quicker than I hoped, especially in the fingertips. Comfort is there; I didn't have any pinching or discomfort, which is a plus. But for the price, I just thought they would hold up better",

I use them mostly for chores around the house and while they work, they don\u2019t feel super durable. After a few uses, I noticed some wear and tear. They fit pretty snug, which is nice, but can get a bit too tight after wearing them for a while. I like the idea of them, just wish they held up better. Overall, not bad, but",
