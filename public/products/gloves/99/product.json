The grip is not nearly as good as expected; I've had better with cheaper alternatives. They fit okay, but they are a bit loose in some areas, which makes it tricky for really detailed work. I also noticed that they started to wear down after only a few uses. Disappointed, given all the hype around them. They're not a total fail, but I can't",

After a few uses, they started to feel too tight and itchy. I swear they sometimes slip when I really need them to hold onto things. Plus, they\u2019re kind of bulky for everyday tasks. I need something more reliable, honestly. It\u2019s a letdown considering the price. If you're looking for solid gloves,",

I was worried about dropping things, which kinda defeats the purpose. Plus, they felt a bit tight after a while, like they weren\u2019t really made for long use. They look nice, but I guess looks aren't everything. I think I\u2019ll look for something a bit sturdier next time. Sorry, but not",
