Literally slipped off my hands when I was washing dishes, and now I have a huge cut. Not even good for light work. Material feels cheap and they smell bad out of the box. Won\u2019t buy again. Save your money!",

            "review": "Really disappointed with these gloves. They tore way too easily and the grip is not good at all. Was hoping for something better since the ads were flashy. Can\u2019t even use them without my hands slipping all over. Also, the fit is weird, not snug even though I measured. I thought I was getting something sturdy, but they feel cheap. Definitely not worth the money. I'll be looking for something else. Don't waste your time!",
