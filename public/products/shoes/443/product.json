I\u2019ve gone on long runs and my feet didn\u2019t ache at all, which is a huge plus. The design is also stylish, I get compliments all the time! \n\nMy only issue is the color choices. I wish there were more options because I\u2019d love to get another pair. They tend to run a little small, so I recommend trying a half size up if you're between sizes. Overall, definitely",
