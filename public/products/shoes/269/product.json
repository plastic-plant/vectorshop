            "review": "I recently tried these shoes and honestly, they\u2019re not bad but not great either. They fit alright, a bit tight around the toe area, which is annoying. The design looks good and gets some compliments, but comfort just isn't quite there for me. I expected a more cushioned feel since that's what they\u2019re marketed for. They do have good grip, so that\u2019s a plus when walking on different surfaces. The color options are nice, though! Overall, I think they\u2019re just okay -",

Sometimes I feel like they fit perfectly, but other times they pinch my toes. Not great for long walks. \n\nThe grip on the sole is decent for indoor stuff, but outside I don\u2019t feel super stable. Plus, the color options are nice but... the material feels a bit cheap. They definitely turn heads",

They look great and the style is on point, but when it comes to comfort, they fall a bit short. I expected something more cushy for my daily walks, but they hurt my feet after a while. The size also feels kind of off; I went for my usual size, but they are a tad snug. \n\nThe sole grips well, so that\u2019s good for outdoor use, but",

Le design est sympa, ils vont bien avec beaucoup de tenues, mais la qualit\u00e9 semble un peu... bon, pas g\u00e9niale. La semelle semble fine et j'ai peur qu'elle s'ab\u00eeme vite.

The comfort level is kinda hit or miss, especially during long walks. I expected them to be more supportive and cushioned. Also, the fit is a bit off; they are either too tight or too loose depending on the socks I wear. \n\nOn the plus side, they do look good and get compliments, which is",
