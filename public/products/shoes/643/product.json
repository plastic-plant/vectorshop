The cushioning is comfy, making them great for long walks or standing all day. I\u2019ve also noticed they have pretty good grip, which is important for me since I sometimes jog on uneven paths.\n\nHowever, I did notice that the sizing runs slightly bigger than expected, so I suggest trying them on first or checking the size guide",

The cushioning inside is super comfy, which makes them great for walking long distances. I really love how lightweight they feel on my feet.\n\nThe only downside I\u2019ve noticed is that the grip on the soles could be a bit better, especially on wet surfaces. I\u2019ve slipped a couple of times turning corners. But aside from that, they fit snugly without being too tight",
