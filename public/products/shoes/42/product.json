The design is pretty nice, and I love the colors, but comfort-wise, they don't meet my expectations. The cushioning isn't as soft as I hoped. After wearing them all day, my feet start to hurt. They fit well at first, but I feel like they might not be very durable. I was expecting more, especially with the price. If you're looking for something stylish, these might do,",

However, comfort-wise, they don\u2019t really stand out. The fit is a bit snug around the toes, and after a few hours, I found myself wanting to switch to something else. \n\nThe grip is decent, but I wouldn't say it\u2019s the best I've experienced. It's fine for short walks, but anything longer starts to feel a bit if",
