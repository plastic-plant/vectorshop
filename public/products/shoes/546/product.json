Plus, the soles didn\u2019t last more than a week. I thought they looked cool but they look cheap up close. I can\u2019t even wear them without pain. Seriously regret buying these. Do not waste your money.",

They pinched my toes when I walked.\ud83d\ude14 The material feels cheap too. \n\nAfter just a few uses, they started falling apart. The sole looks all worn out already! \ud83d\ude21 I don\u2019t get what the hype is about. I was expecting at least some support, but felt like I was walking on the ground with no cushion.

Adem\u00e1s, la calidad es terrible, ya se les nota desgaste despu\u00e9s de solo un par de d\u00edas. Y no hablemos de la talla, \u00a1totalmente incorrecta! Las compr\u00e9 en mi tama\u00f1o y me quedan peque\u00f1as. Definitivamente no las recomendar\u00eda. Una gran perdida de dinero.",

Colour was nice but that doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re unusable. really regretting this purchase. total waste of money.",
