The cushioning is decent but not plush enough for long walks. The sizing seems a bit off too; I normally wear an 8, but these felt tight around the toes. They also took a few days to break in. However, I\u2019ve received compliments on them, so that\u2019s a plus. Overall, not bad, just wish they felt better for",

They look super cool and have a nice design, but the comfort isn\u2019t quite what I expected. The cushioning is okay, but after walking for a while, my feet start to ache a bit.

The cushion is okay, not too soft and not too firm, so can feel a bit off sometimes. The style is pretty cool, but they squeak a lot when I walk, which can be really annoying.
