They\u2019re super comfortable right out of the box, which isn\u2019t always the case with new kicks.

Ich habe normalerweise Probleme mit meinen F\u00fc\u00dfen, aber diese Schuhe sind so bequem und passen perfekt. Das Material ist angenehm und die D\u00e4mpfung f\u00fchlt sich toll an, besonders beim Laufen. \n\nDas Design ist auch klasse, sieht modern aus und ich bekomme viele Komplimente. Einziger kleiner Nachteil k\u00f6nnten die Schn\u00fcrsenkel sein, die manchmal etwas rutschen, aber das ist nicht so schlimm",

I love how lightweight they feel, and the cushioning really supports my feet during long days.
