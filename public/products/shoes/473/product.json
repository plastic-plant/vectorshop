The comfort level isn\u2019t really there; they feel kinda stiff and rub against my heels. I thought they would be supportive for long walks or casual days but ended up with sore feet. The sole seems durable, but they slip a bit on wet surfaces, which is a bit unsettling. Also, I\u2019ve noticed some seams are coming apart already. With",

However, comfort? Not so much. The fit feels off, and after wearing them for even a short walk, my feet were aching.\n\nI also expected some innovative features since the hype was pretty strong, but I didn't notice anything remarkable. They felt more like regular sneakers and not what I hoped for in terms of technology.",

I got sore feet after just a short walk, and for the price, I expected way better. The fit is weird too\u2014too tight in some spots and loose in others.
