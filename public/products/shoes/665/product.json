The fit is kind of odd\u2014too tight in some spots and way too loose in others. Plus, the sole feels like it's not padded enough. I expected more comfort for the price. Maybe it's just me, but I\u2019ve had better luck with other brands. I'm not sure I'll keep wearing them.",

I was expecting to walk around and feel supported, but my feet started hurting after a short time. It\u2019s really disappointing since they look nice, but it feels like could use more cushioning. \n\nThe fit is also weird. I ordered my usual size, and they feel too tight around the sides but oddly loose around the heel. I thought maybe it was just me",

The design looks cool at first glance, but once I tried them on, it was like walking on bricks. I thought they\u2019d be comfy but my feet started hurting after like an hour. The sizing is also off; I had to order a size up but it\u2019s still kinda tight in the toes. Not exactly what I was looking for.\n\nAlso, they kinda make a weird noise when I walk",

The fit is a bit snug, and I thought they would be more comfortable. I've worn them a few times, and they make my feet hurt! The material doesn't breathe well either, my feet get sweaty super quick.\n\nThey look nice, I\u2019ll give them that, but fashion over comfort isn\u2019t really my thing. Plus",

I've tried wearing them for a couple of days, but they definitely hurt my feet after a while. The soles also feel really thin, and I don't think they are gonna last long. I thought they were gonna be comfy enough for daily wear, but I'm just not feeling it. The style is nice, but comfort is key, you know",
