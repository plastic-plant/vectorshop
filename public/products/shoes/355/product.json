Pas tr\u00e8s confortables non plus. Mes pieds me font mal apr\u00e8s seulement une heure. Et la taille ne correspond pas vraiment. J\u2019ai pris ma taille habituelle, mais \u00e7a serre un peu trop. J\u2019ai vu des avis de gens qui aimaient, mais moi j\u2019en suis d\u00e9\u00e7u.",

I expected more cushioning, but it feels like I'm walking on hard ground. The design is cool, but it's not enough to make up for the discomfort. Plus, the color started fading after just a few wears. Overall, not impressed. I\u2019d recommend looking elsewhere if you want something really comfy.",

I got my usual size, but they felt way too loose and didn\u2019t offer any support. Plus, after just a week of wearing them, the material started to fray a little, which is disappointing. It\u2019s like they\u2019re not sturdy at all. I thought they\u2019d be great for all day wear, but I ended up with sore feet by midday.",
