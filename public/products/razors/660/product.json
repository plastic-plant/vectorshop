I thought it was just me, but tried again and same thing. it just doesn't cut well at all. stuck in my hair and left patches everywhere. the blade feel dull and flimsy. I ended up with cuts on my skin, totally not what I signed up for. honestly, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. save your money and look for something better. so dissappointed.",

I thought the design would be cool, but feels cheap and slips around in my hand. I ended up with nicks and irritation. Honestly, I\u2019ve had better results with a dull butter knife. Save your money, don\u2019t buy this.",

Total waste of money! Plus, the handle feels cheap, I dropped it once and the thing cracked. The blades are supposed to be sharp but they irritate my skin more than anything. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Just stick to the good old ones, save your cash. Ugh.",

I thought it\u2019d make shaving easier, but it just made it annoying. Plus, it kinda pulls at my hair instead of gliding like it should. Really disappointed. Just a waste of money. Wish I could give it zero stars.",

Plus, it pulls on my hair instead of just shaving. It feels like a total waste of money. I really don't understand all the hype, because this is just frustrating to use. Save your cash and get something else! \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udc4e",
