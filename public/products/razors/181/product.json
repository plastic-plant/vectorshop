Felt like I was dragging a brick across my skin. And don't even get me started on how quickly it rusted. I kept it dry and everything! Just a waste of money, I won\u2019t be using it again. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one. Really regret buying it.",

A durabilidade \u00e9 horr\u00edvel, j\u00e1 t\u00e1 todo torto depois de uma semana. Senti at\u00e9 dor na pele, ficou irritada! N\u00e3o tenho mais paci\u00eancia pra usar. N\u00e3o recomendo pra ningu\u00e9m, vale mais a pena gastar um pouco mais em algo que funcione de verdade!",
