I have to go over some spots multiple times, which is a bit frustrating. The handle feels a bit flimsy too, like it could break if I'm not careful. I appreciate the design, but it just doesn't give me that clean shave I'm looking for. It's decent, but I'm already thinking about trying something else. Overall, not the worst, but",

Intent\u00e9 ajustar el \u00e1ngulo, pero nada me funciona. El dise\u00f1o parece prometedor, pero en la pr\u00e1ctica no genera buenos resultados. Termin\u00e9 utilizando otro en su lugar. Un par de amigos tambi\u00e9n tuvieron problemas, as\u00ed que no soy yo sola. No lo recomendar\u00eda, est\u00e1 lejos de ser \u201cincre\u00edble\u201d, como lo promet\u00edan.",

It feels like it gets stuck pretty easily and I end up having to go over the same spots multiple times. I thought I'd get a nice smooth shave, but it just gets irritated instead. Also, it doesn't last as long as I hoped, and after a few uses, it starts to tug and pull. I mean, for the price, I was expecting better.",

The design looked nice, and I was excited to try it, but it didn\u2019t glide as well as I expected. I had to go over spots multiple times to get a close shave, which is super frustrating. Also, it seemed to irritate my skin more than other razors do. Not great for sensitive areas. Maybe it works for some people, but for me, it was just a letdown.",
