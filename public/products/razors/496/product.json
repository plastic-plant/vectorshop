The blades don\u2019t feel sharp at all, more like they\u2019re dull or something. Couldn\u2019t even finish my shave without bleeding. Plus, it feels cheap in the hand. Honestly wish I hadn\u2019t wasted my money. Not worth it at all, save your bucks!!",

I can\u2019t believe people give it good reviews. steer clear of this one; you\u2019ll regret it! Save yourself the trouble and buy anything else. I'm really disappointed.",

The blades are awful and don\u2019t cut well at all. It feels cheap too, like I could break it anytime. I\u2019m really disappointed and will not recommend. Just save your money and get a better one.",
