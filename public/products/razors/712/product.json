            "review": "This razor is a total joke. The blades barely cut, and I ended up with more nicks than I care to count. It doesn't glide at all; feels like I'm dragging a rock over my skin. The design is awful, too\u2014really awkward to hold. Honestly, I'd rather use an old-school disposable than this. Save your money and look for something better. I'm really disappointed.",

            "review": "The razor is just terrible. I found it cut me more than it was supposed to. It feels cheap and does not even shave close. The blade was dull after one use \u2013 seriously like I was just dragging a plastic piece across my skin. Uncomfortable and disappointed. I expected better for the price. Waste of money. Not worth the hassle, I\u2019m going back to my old one. Avoid this at all costs.",

I thought it might help with my sensitive skin but no it\u2019s even worse! The handle is awkward to hold and I dropped it twice already because it feels cheap. Don\u2019t waste your money! Just stick to what works. Gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero.",
