Muito feias, n\u00e3o parecem nada com as fotos do site. Usei uma vez e j\u00e1 tem risco. N\u00e3o recomendo. Uma grande decep\u00e7\u00e3o!!",

I was really hoping for something that could handle everyday use, but they chipped after just one week. Plus, they don\u2019t feel like real dishes. More like cheap plastic. I can\u2019t see these in any nice setting, too embarrassing. Overall really disappointed. Don\u2019t waste your money on this.",

I had one slip from my hand and it cracked right down the middle! Was so mad. Also they don\u2019t stack well, takes too much space in the cupboard. Eating off them was no better, they stain quick and the design faded. Really not worth the money. Save yourself and buy something else.",
