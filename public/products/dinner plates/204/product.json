But, after using them a few times, I've noticed a few things. \n\nThey\u2019re a bit heavier than I expected, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it makes it hard when stacking them into the cupboard. Also, I found that some of the plates started showing scratches after just a few uses.",

Die erste Sp\u00fclmaschine hat ein paar Kratzer hinterlassen und ich erwarte, dass die Teller langlebiger sind. Sie sind auch ein wenig schwerer als ich dachte, was beim Stapeln nicht so einfach ist. Insgesamt bin ich zwar mit dem Aussehen der Teller zufrieden, aber ich hatte mir mehr erhofft. Vielleicht f\u00fcr den Preis k\u00f6nnte man etwas Besseres",

They chip pretty easily and after a few uses, I already noticed some scratches. The size is good for portion control, but they don't stack very well in my cabinet. I wanted to love them since they look fancy, but overall they're just average. Cool for casual dinners but wouldn\u2019t use them for special occasions. I mean, they",

But, I\u2019ve noticed some drawbacks that keep me from loving them entirely. \n\nThe colors are stunning and really pop. I got the deep blue ones, and they add a nice touch to our dinners. However, they\u2019re super thin and feel kinda fragile; I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll hold up over time. I\u2019ve already noticed a couple of scratches",

I carefully hand wash them but still noticed a small chip after a week, which is disappointing. The size is decent and they fit well in the dishwasher, but they also feel a bit heavy. I liked the design at first, but it doesn't seem super practical for everyday use, which is what I was hoping for. Overall, they are okay, but I probably wouldn't",
