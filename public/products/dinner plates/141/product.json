Not even dishwasher safe as advertised! Totally regret buying them. I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Save your money.",

I\u2019ve already got a couple of cracks after just a few uses. It\u2019s like they crack at the slightest bump. Also, the designs looked super pretty online but in person they're kinda faded and not really bright. Definitely thought it would be better for the price I paid. Honestly, save your money and look somewhere else. Really not worth it",
