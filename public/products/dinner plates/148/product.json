One plate actually chipped after just a few uses, which was super disappointing. They don\u2019t hold heat well at all; my food is cold by the time I\u2019m ready to eat. The size is okay, but I expected more depth for serving pasta or salads. I've seen better for the price; I wouldn\u2019t recommend these",

De uitstraling is leuk, dat kan ik niet ontkennen, maar kwaliteit komt uiteindelijk niet overeen. Na een paar keer gebruiken, begonnen er al krassen op te komen. Het is frustrerend omdat ze zo gepresenteerd werden als duurzaam en perfect voor dagelijkse maaltijden. Ook vond ik ze niet lekker in de hand liggen, een beetje te zwaar en niet prettig om mee te eten. Ik hoop dat het nog kan",

The design is pretty, but they\u2019re super heavy and hard to stack. I dropped one while washing, and it chipped easily. Also, they feel kinda cheap when you\u2019re eating off them, like they might crack if you\u2019re not careful. \n\nThe sizes are a little off too; the dinner plates feel more like salad plates. I wish I could love them more",

They chip way too easily, I\u2019ve only had them a few weeks and there are already some noticeable nicks. Also, they don't stack well in the cupboard, always feeling like they might topple over. The surface stains pretty quickly too, even after normal meals. Clean up isn't as effortless as I expected. For",

I was worried they would break easily, especially during everyday use. Plus, they don\u2019t stack well in my cabinet, which is super annoying. I had to return a set because one of the plates came with a big scratch. For the price, I expected better quality. Guess I'll stick with the old set a little longer. Would not recommend unless you want",
