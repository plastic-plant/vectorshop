The design is pretty nice, very earthy and unique, which I really like. They seem sturdy enough at first glance, but I\u2019ve noticed some scratches after only a few uses and I\u2019m a bit worried about how they\u2019ll hold up long-term.\n\nThey\u2019re pretty heavy, which I guess adds to the quality, but it makes stacking them a bit awkward.

The design is quite nice, with that earthy vibe everyone seems to love, but they don\u2019t quite feel as sturdy as I expected. Had a little scare when I dropped one - thankfully, it didn\u2019t break, but it chipped a bit. They\u2019re dishwasher safe, which is a plus, but the food tends to slide around more than I\u2019d like, especially when serving pasta. They look good on the table, definitely",

The design is pretty cool and they do add a nice touch to dinner, but I found them a bit heavy. Not a big deal, but I expected something lighter for everyday use. They\u2019re also not as sturdy as I thought. I've noticed a few tiny scratches after just a couple of uses, which is disappointing. For the price, I expected better durability.

After just a few uses, I noticed some minor scratches, which is disappointing.\n\nWashing them is fine, but I feel like they need extra care because they might chip easily if you aren't careful. They don't stack perfectly either, which is a bit annoying when storing. Overall, I think they might work for impressing guests",

The design is nice, and they do look pretty on the table, but durability is a bit of a concern. I've had one chip already after just a few weeks of use, and that\u2019s not what I expected. Plus, they\u2019re a little heavier than I thought, which makes them tricky to handle for smaller kids. They wash well, though, and the",
