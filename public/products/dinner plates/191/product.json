For one, I noticed some scratches forming after just a couple of uses, which is kinda disappointing. Also, the size is kind of awkward for some meals. You end up piling things on, and it doesn't always fit. \n\nThey wash up fine in the dishwasher, though, so that\u2019s a plus. I guess they work",

Apr\u00e8s quelques utilisations, j'ai remarqu\u00e9 quelques rayures d\u00e9j\u00e0. Elles sont l\u00e9g\u00e8res, ce qui est bien, mais j'ai peur de les casser facilement. Pour un repas quotidien, \u00e7a fait le job, mais je ne suis pas totalement convaincu. J'attendais un peu mieux pour le prix. Peut",

One of mine chipped on the edge after just a few uses, which was disappointing. They\u2019re nice for serving guests, but I wouldn't recommend them for everyday use if you have kids or tend to drop things. The size is good for portion control, but the design kind of makes it hard to stack in my cupboard. Overall, they\u2019re fine, not",

The design is nice, and they definitely look good on the table, but they can be a bit heavy and awkward to handle. I've noticed some scratches after just a few uses, which is disappointing. They\u2019re great for presentation, but in terms of practicality, they fall a little short. They could be more durable, and the size is a tad smaller than I expected. Not a bad choice if you're just going",
