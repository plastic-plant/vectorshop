Tried putting them in the dishwasher but they came out dirty. They feel cheap and brittle, one of mine broke during dinner! \n\nNot worth the money at all. Just stick with regular plates, these are a waste of time and frustrate me every time I use them! Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",

The size isn't right for normal meals, too small. Tried to return but it\u2019s a hassle. Would not recommend to anyone.",
