However, I was hoping for something that holds up a little better in the dishwasher. I\u2019ve noticed some scratches after a few uses, which is kinda disappointing. They\u2019re lightweight, which is nice, but that also means they can feel a bit flimsy when you stack them. Overall, they do the job, but there\u2019s definitely room for improvement",

I\u2019ve already noticed a few scratches after just a couple of uses. The design is pretty, but it could be a bit deeper for pasta dishes or\u2014like those saucy meals I love. \n\nThey wash fine in the dishwasher, so I can\u2019t complain too much there. It gets the job done, but I expected something a bit",

They look nice enough, with a cool design and everything, but they\u2019re a bit heavier than I would like. When I stack them, It takes up a bit more space than my old plates used to. \n\nThe size is decent for dinner meals, but some of my food spills over sometimes, which is annoying. I\u2019ve had some scratches appear after a few uses too,",
