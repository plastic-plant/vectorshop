            "review": "I was really dissapointed with these plates. They don\u2019t hold up at all. After just one use they started to chip and crack. The design looked nice online but in person it\u2019s just cheap and flimsy. I thought they would be durable for everyday use, but nope. Plus, they stain super easily. Managed to get sauce marks that wouldn\u2019t come off no matter how hard I scrubbed. Waste of money honestly. Don't buy.",

The colors chip off easily too, after just a few washes. They don\u2019t even hold up in the microwave, just a complete waste of money. I expected better for the price. Save yourself the troubles, do NOT recommend.",

Het lijkt wel of ik elke keer dat ik ze pak bang ben dat ze breken. Na een paar keer gebruik hebben ze al krassen en vlekken! Ik dacht dat ze mooi zouden zijn, maar de kleuren vervagen gewoon. Zelfs mijn kinderen willen deze borden niet gebruiken. Ik zou ze helemaal niet aanraden aan iemand. Geldverspilling",
