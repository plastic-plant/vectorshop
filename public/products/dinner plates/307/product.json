I was hoping they would be durable for everyday use, but they chip way too easily. I\u2019ve had a couple for less than a month, and already there's a noticeable crack on one. They\u2019re not microwave safe either, which is a big downside for me. Overall, they do look nice on the table, but I can't use them without worrying they\u2019ll",

I've noticed a few scratches after just a couple of uses, and they chip way too easily. Not what I thought for the price I paid. They look nice on the table, but I worry about them surviving regular meals. If you're looking for durability, I'd say keep looking. Kind of disappointing overall.",
