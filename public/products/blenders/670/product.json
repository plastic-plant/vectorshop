The design looked great, but it struggles with basic tasks, like smoothies and soups. I used it a few times, and it started making weird noises, almost like it was protesting. The motor doesn\u2019t seem strong enough, and I had to cut my fruits into tiny pieces to avoid jamming. Clean-up is a hassle, and it leaks if you try to make anything a bit watery. Super frustrating",

It struggles with smoothies, leaving chunks behind, and that's a bummer. The sound it makes is kinda annoying too\u2014super loud for a kitchen appliance. \n\nI had high hopes for the blending speed, but it\u2019s not quite fast enough for what I need. Cleanup is okay, but honestly, I wouldn't mind",

It's super noisy when blending, and it struggles with even the easiest of tasks. I tried to make a simple smoothie, and it left chunks everywhere. Plus, the clean-up is annoying. The lid doesn't fit right, and food gets stuck in the grooves. Pretty frustrating given how much I spent.  I'll keep using it for now but not impressed at",

Het lijkt wel een goede mix te maken, maar na een paar weken begon het raar te slierten en leek het steeds minder goed zijn werk te doen. De knoppen reageren soms niet, en het moet er soms echt voor duwen. En ja, de handleiding is niet echt duidelijk. Er zijn zeker betere blenders op de markt. Voor deze prijs verwacht je",

Sometimes it leaves chunks in my smoothies, which is kind of the point of having a blender, right? It's also a bit loud, more than what I thought it would be. The design is nice, I\u2019ll give it that, but the performance hasn\u2019t matched up to my needs. Maybe it just doesn\u2019t work for my recipes? The cleanup is",
