I\u2019ve tried making smoothies, but they come out chunky since it struggles with tougher ingredients like spinach or frozen fruits. Also, sometimes it just randomly shuts off mid-use! I thought it was just overheating, but it happened a couple of times even when I gave it breaks. Cleanup isn\u2019t bad, but if it can",

The design is nice, looks good on my counter, but that's about where the pros stop. It struggles to blend even soft fruits smoothly, and I find myself having to stop it and shake the pitcher. The motor seems week, kinda loud too. It even leaked from the bottom once which is not ideal for my kitchen. Cleanup is not great either because of all the nooks and",

It struggles with frozen fruit and doesn\u2019t really chop anything super fine. I was expecting smooth smoothies, but they come out a bit chunky. \n\nAlso, the design is kind of bulky for my counter space. I spilled a bit when pouring because the spout doesn't direct well. I\u2019ve had better experiences with other brands in this price range, honestly. Cleanup isn't",

I keep getting chunks in my smoothies, which is super frustrating. The motor is kinda weak too. Every time I try to make a nut butter, it just gets stuck or won\u2019t blend well at all. Cleanup is easy enough, but if it can't blend properly, what\u2019s the point? Also, the noise level is pretty",
