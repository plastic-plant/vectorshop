Sometimes it struggles with frozen fruits, which is a bit annoying when I'm trying to make my smoothies. The motor is not the quietest either, which can be irritating. \n\nOn the flip side, I like how easy it is to clean, and it looks nice on my counter. The controls are straightforward, but I wish there was one for pulses",

It blends okay but sometimes leaves chunks, and I have to go back and do it again. The noise is way louder than I expected, which kinda drives me crazy when I\u2019m trying to make a smoothie in the morning. \n\nCleaning it can be a hassle too. The parts fit together snugly, but I feel like it takes more time to take apart",

The design looks nice on the counter and it doesn\u2019t take up too much space, but it\u2019s not as powerful as I hoped. It struggles with tougher ingredients like leafy greens or hard fruits, sometimes leaving chunks behind. The button interface is a bit confusing too, with all the presets. I find myself using the manual setting most of the time to get a smoother blend.\n\nCleaning is fairly easy, which is",
