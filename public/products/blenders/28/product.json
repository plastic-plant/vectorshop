Al principio parec\u00eda prometedora, pero despu\u00e9s de unos d\u00edas de uso, empez\u00f3 a dejar de funcionar como deber\u00eda. Complementos a veces no encajan bien y es muy ruidosa, no puedo usarla sin molestar a los dem\u00e1s en casa. Adem\u00e1s, no lic\u00faa bien algunas frutas y quedan grumos. La limpieza tambi\u00e9n es un problema, se quedan residuos y es dif\u00edcil. As\u00ed que aunque no es totalmente in\u00fatil,",

It does blend smoothies and juices just fine, but it struggles with harder ingredients like ice and frozen fruits. I\u2019ve noticed it can\u2019t maintain speed and tends to stall out occasionally. Clean-up is a hassle too; it\u2019s hard to reach some parts and I worry about durability because the plastic feels cheap. For the price, I expected better performance and sturdiness. It gets the job done, but there are",

It struggles with ice and leaves chunks in my smoothies. Also, the motor feels weak; sometimes it just stops in the middle of blending! I even tried different settings and it didn\u2019t help much. \n\nCleaning is a bit of a pain too. You have to take everything apart and the blades are hard to handle",
