They feel soft at first, but sadly they don\u2019t absorb water as well as I thought they would. After a shower, I found myself reaching for more than one just to dry off properly. The colors are nice, but that\u2019s about it. They also take forever to dry after washing, which is super inconvenient. For the price, I expected something much better.

They feel softer than I thought they would, but after a couple of washes, they started to lose fluffiness and absorbency. I expected them to soak up water better than they do. They kind of just glide over my skin when I try to dry off. It's pretty frustrating since I was looking for something cozy and reliable. Would probably look for other brands next time. Quite the disappointment overall.",
