The feel is nice and they look good hanging in the bathroom, but they\u2019re not super absorbent. It takes a while to get dried off after a shower. Plus, they do take longer than I expected to dry completely. I don\u2019t hate them, but I feel like I can find better options out there. They\u2019re decent for decor, but for actual use?
