Plus, they feel kinda scratchy, not soft at all. After one wash, they're already fraying and look like they\u2019ve been through a war. Totally disappointed, waste of money, won't be using them again. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone!",

They don't dry properly, so you end up with musty smelling towels. Plus, they shed like crazy in the wash! I've tried to give them a chance but really wish I hadn't wasted my money. Definitely do not recommend!",

They also feel really rough on my skin, not soft like I expected. After just one wash, they started to fray around the edges. They look horrible now. Seriously regret buying these. Save your money and get something else.",

I tried using them after a shower and it took forever to dry off, like using a plastic bag. Also started to fall apart after a few washes, threads everywhere. Honestly, I don\u2019t see how anyone likes these. Would not recommend, save your money.",

I used them after a shower and it felt like I was drying off with a piece of sandpaper. What\u2019s the point of a towel if it can\u2019t even dry you properly?! Plus, they smell weird after washing them. I tried getting rid of the smell but nothing worked. Do yourself a favor and overskip these. Save your money for something",
