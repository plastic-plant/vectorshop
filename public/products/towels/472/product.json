They do feel soft at first, but after a few washes, they started to lose that plushness. They absorb water decently but my old towels did a better job. I also noticed some stitching coming loose on one of them, which is a little concerning. They look nice hanging up, but in terms of performance, they're not exactly blowing me away. I guess",

However, they seem to be slower to dry than I expected, which can be frustrating. I\u2019ve noticed some loose threads after a few washes, which makes me doubt their durability. For the price, I thought I\u2019d get something a bit sturdier. Overall, decent product, but not quite living up to the hype.",

However, I've noticed that they don\u2019t absorb water as well as I expected. After a shower, I felt like I was just rubbing the water around rather than actually drying off. \n\nThe colors are nice and they do look good in my bathroom.

But they don't seem to hold up well after a few washes. The color started fading a bit too. I also expected them to dry quicker, but they still feel damp after hanging for a bit. \n\nIt\u2019s not a terrible product, and if you don\u2019t mind replacing towels every so often, they\u2019re okay.

Ze voelen lekker zacht aan, maar nadat ik ze meerdere keren gewassen heb, lijken ze wel minder pluizig ofzo. Ze drogen mijn huid oke, maar niet echt sneller dan andere handdoeken die ik heb. \n\nHet design vind ik wel mooi, het past goed in mijn badkamer. Maar de drogers hebben ook niet zo'n goede werking als",
