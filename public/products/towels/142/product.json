They don\u2019t absorb water at all, feels like I'm drying off with a plastic bag. \ud83d\ude12 Had to go back to my old ones which work way better. Also, they shed everywhere! Like, everywhere. Just a big mess. Definitely not worth the money. Save your cash and look for something else!",

The colors faded after just one wash. The stitching is coming undone too, not even worth the money I spent. I regret buying them. Save your cash and look elsewhere.",

Had high hopes but every time I use them, I just get frustrated. They started falling apart after a few washes too. No thanks, wouldn\u2019t recommend.",

Plus, they feel rough on the skin, not soft like you\u2019d expect! After a few washes, they started to fray already. I expected way more for the price. Would not recommend to anyone. Total waste of money.",

I mean, towels are supposed to be comfy right? And they don\u2019t absorb water well either. Took forever to dry off. Plus, they started getting weird fuzzies after a few washes. Just a waste of money honestly. Not worth it at all, I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone. Save your cash!",
