Way too thin to beany good. I was expecting soft and fluffy, but got rough and scratchy. So disapointing. Honestly, I wouldn't wipe my dog with these. Total waste of money. Never again.",

It takes ages to dry off and they still smell weird after washing. I don\u2019t get what all the hype is about. I regret buying them. Definitely not worth the money. Save yourself the trouble and look for something better!",
