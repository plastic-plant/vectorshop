They\u2019re also really soft, which is a nice touch after a shower. I love how quick they dry too; I\u2019ve had issues before with towels staying damp and getting that musty smell, but these don\u2019t. \n\nThe only downside is that after a few washes, I noticed they lost a little fluffiness, but",
